the
mystery
of
the
deserted
village
chapter
ronnie
was
in
the
hayloft
sliding
down
the
piles
of
newly
stacked
hay
when
he
heard
the
car
drive
up
into
the
yard
and
come
to
a
stop
spitting
a
mouthful
of
hayseeds
from
his
lips
and
tongue
he
ran
over
to
the
open
doors
and
peered
down
into
the
yard
the
car
was
shiny
and
new
a
big
black
sedan
with
white
walled
tires
a
man
in
a
business
suit
carrying
a
briefcase
climbed
out
of
the
driver
s
seat
and
headed
briskly
for
the
front
door
of
the
house
ronnie
knew
who
he
was
and
why
he
was
here
and
his
heart
sank
why
did
the
st
lawrence
seaway
need
a
piece
of
the
rorth
farm
land
and
why
did
it
have
to
be
just
that
part
where
the
deserted
village
lay
of
course
he
really
knew
the
answers
to
his
questions
what
he
meant
was
why
did
it
have
to
happen
that
way
why
did
the
land
have
to
be
so
low
that
when
the
dam
was
built
and
the
waters
of
the
st
lawrence
river
began
to
pile
up
behind
it
the
deserted
village
would
be
flooded
he
thought
of
grandfather
and
father
in
the
parlor
talking
with
the
man
and
he
wondered
about
what
they
were
saying
and
how
it
would
all
turn
out
the
last
time
mr
evans
had
come
in
his
black
sedan
grandfather
had
gotten
very
angry
and
ronnie
had
heard
him
shouting
and
thumping
his
cane
on
the
floor
ronnie
went
over
to
the
opening
in
the
loft
floor
and
grasping
the
ladder
climbed
quickly
down
to
the
bottom
it
was
darker
below
and
for
a
moment
the
boy
had
trouble
seeing
his
way
he
heard
beatrice
stamping
in
her
stall
and
smelled
the
sharp
pungent
odor
of
fresh
manure
his
bare
feet
padded
across
the
hard
earth
floor
as
he
moved
toward
the
barn
door
a
moment
later
he
was
out
in
the
glaring
sunlight
the
full
heat
of
the
afternoon
striking
him
on
his
bare
shoulders
and
back
he
saw
his
brother
phil
lying
in
the
hammock
beneath
the
grape
arbor
hey
phil
he
called
that
man
s
here
again
phil
opened
his
eyes
lazily
what
man
he
asked
indifferently
ronnie
squatted
down
beside
him
the
man
from
the
seaway
of
course
i
just
hope
grandfather
gets
hopping
mad
again
and
gives
it
to
him
good
nobody
s
got
a
right
to
just
come
along
and
tell
a
person
he
s
got
to
sell
his
land
nobody
phil
closed
his
eyes
again
and
started
the
hammock
swinging
of
course
you
don
t
care
one
bit
philip
rorth
ronnie
continued
i
think
grandfather
was
right
he
said
you
re
not
a
real
rorth
cause
a
real
rorth
s
got
fighting
blood
and
a
love
for
his
land
and
most
of
all
he
wouldn
t
let
the
village
go
without
a
fight
phil
opened
his
left
eye
and
squinted
up
at
his
brother
all
the
fighting
in
the
world
s
not
going
to
save
the
village
ronnie
cause
when
the
government
wants
something
it
gets
it
period
ronnie
turned
away
in
disgust
what
could
he
expect
of
phil
his
brother
had
never
gotten
excited
about
anything
and
he
probably
never
would
he
headed
toward
the
other
side
of
the
house
partly
because
it
was
shady
there
but
mostly
because
he
knew
the
parlor
window
was
open
and
he
might
be
able
to
hear
what
was
going
on
inside
he
passed
the
woodshed
and
swung
around
the
corner
of
the
house
almost
immediately
he
heard
grandfather
s
voice
why
young
fellow
do
you
know
this
land
s
been
in
the
family
close
onto
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
and
you
come
along
and
without
so
much
as
a
how
do
you
do
tell
me
i
got
to
up
and
off
it
hah
well
i
ve
got
a
lawyer
too
to
protect
my
rights
ronnie
settled
down
in
the
shade
near
the
lilac
bushes
he
really
wasn
t
eavesdropping
he
d
been
wanting
to
weed
the
lily
of
the
valley
bed
for
some
time
now
and
this
was
a
perfect
time
to
do
it
with
the
sun
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
he
grabbed
hold
of
a
ragweed
and
started
to
pull
it
but
he
stopped
tugging
after
a
few
seconds
so
he
could
hear
what
mr
evans
was
saying
mr
rorth
the
man
said
his
voice
like
a
whisper
compared
to
grandfather
s
mr
rorth
i
wish
you
d
try
to
understand
we
he
didn
t
get
any
further
because
when
grandfather
was
angry
he
didn
t
usually
give
anyone
else
much
time
to
talk
i
don
t
understand
eh
well
young
fellow
i
understand
just
fine
and
just
don
t
you
bother
giving
me
any
more
of
that
hogwash
about
how
wonderful
it
will
be
when
big
ships
can
come
sailing
down
the
river
from
the
ocean
to
the
great
lakes
because
that
doesn
t
touch
me
one
bit
ronnie
heard
his
father
s
voice
next
father
said
mr
rorth
it
doesn
t
do
a
bit
of
good
getting
yourself
all
upset
like
this
the
seaway
authority
has
told
us
that
the
water
level
of
the
lake
formed
behind
the
dam
will
cover
the
section
of
land
where
the
deserted
village
is
and
for
this
reason
it
will
have
to
be
purchased
there
isn
t
a
thing
we
can
do
about
it
our
lawyer
has
told
us
that
himself
more
hogwash
sometimes
i
think
that
lawyer
is
working
for
both
sides
and
against
the
middle
the
weed
came
loose
from
the
ground
with
a
suddenness
that
sent
ronnie
reeling
backward
before
he
could
catch
himself
he
had
crashed
against
the
side
of
the
house
when
he
looked
up
there
was
his
father
peering
at
him
from
behind
the
screen
ronnie
what
are
you
doing
out
there
i
i
m
weeding
the
lily
of
the
valley
he
managed
to
stammer
well
you
d
better
weed
it
some
other
time
now
go
somewhere
else
y
yes
sir
ronnie
wandered
away
toward
the
front
of
the
house
he
felt
ashamed
for
having
been
caught
snooping
and
he
was
peeved
at
himself
too
he
wanted
to
hear
what
happened
next
he
hoped
and
prayed
that
there
could
be
something
that
would
save
the
village
almost
without
thinking
he
headed
across
the
dirt
road
that
led
out
to
the
paved
highway
and
then
he
entered
the
apple
orchard
the
blossoms
had
faded
already
and
in
their
place
were
clusters
of
tiny
green
knobs
with
big
whiskers
on
the
ends
a
few
minutes
later
he
left
the
orchard
and
stood
for
a
moment
at
the
top
of
the
bluff
looking
down
into
the
tight
little
valley
where
the
buildings
of
the
deserted
village
lay
half
hidden
among
the
hemlocks
and
spruce
and
maples
and
oaks
great
great
grandfather
ezra
rorth
s
father
had
built
the
village
and
had
chosen
a
beautiful
location
the
brick
and
stone
buildings
were
nestled
comfortably
in
the
deep
ravine
a
cobbled
road
ran
through
the
center
of
the
village
and
goose
brook
raced
along
its
rock
strewn
course
down
to
the
st
lawrence
every
time
he
stopped
to
look
at
the
village
from
up
here
on
the
bluff
ronnie
thought
of
grandfather
when
ronnie
was
hardly
old
enough
to
walk
his
grandfather
had
brought
him
here
for
many
years
after
that
the
old
man
and
the
boy
had
walked
together
down
the
cobbled
road
in
the
late
evenings
and
grandfather
had
told
stories
of
the
days
when
the
village
was
alive
with
people
and
the
glass
furnace
belched
smoke
day
and
night
and
rorth
glassware
was
known
almost
around
the
world
now
as
always
the
village
drew
ronnie
like
a
magnet
he
raced
down
the
face
of
the
bluff
whirling
his
arms
about
like
propeller
blades
to
keep
his
balance
at
the
bottom
he
stopped
now
that
he
was
here
he
couldn
t
decide
just
which
part
of
the
village
he
wanted
to
visit
he
could
swing
on
the
wild
grapevines
in
front
of
the
gristmill
and
maybe
take
off
his
trousers
and
go
sailing
feet
first
into
the
millpond
or
he
could
have
fun
climbing
around
on
the
pile
of
rubble
that
remained
from
the
old
bakery
building
he
decided
to
visit
the
old
padlocked
boarded
up
building
which
had
been
the
office
of
the
glassworks
back
in
great
great
grandfather
ezra
s
days
he
started
down
the
path
keeping
his
eyes
open
for
any
big
toadstools
he
could
splatter
against
a
tree
trunk
then
he
spied
bill
his
best
friend
was
coming
through
the
trees
from
the
opposite
direction
ronnie
put
his
fingers
to
his
lips
and
whistled
shrilly
i
was
just
coming
over
to
your
place
bill
greeted
him
where
are
you
headed
no
place
special
thought
maybe
i
d
climb
around
on
the
old
office
building
roof
and
maybe
get
a
look
at
that
swift
nest
down
the
chimney
you
figuring
on
something
else
nope
they
started
down
the
path
together
you
know
ronnie
bill
said
as
they
came
to
the
cobblestone
road
through
the
middle
of
the
village
you
know
i
d
sure
like
to
get
a
look
inside
that
building
sometime
how
come
your
grandfather
keeps
it
all
locked
up
with
shutters
on
the
windows
he
s
had
it
open
once
or
twice
i
ve
never
seen
it
open
i
guess
that
s
because
he
hasn
t
opened
it
up
since
we
were
big
enough
to
remember
ronnie
said
my
pa
was
talking
about
it
the
other
night
he
said
it
s
supposed
to
be
haunted
you
believe
that
ronnie
ronnie
thought
it
over
maybe
maybe
not
he
wouldn
t
let
bill
know
how
he
really
felt
grandfather
never
seemed
to
want
to
talk
about
the
building
so
perhaps
there
was
something
that
he
wanted
to
hide
of
course
ronnie
had
heard
the
stories
from
others
about
how
his
great
great
grandfather
ezra
had
killed
someone
in
the
office
building
and
had
robbed
the
glassworks
of
money
no
two
people
told
the
same
story
and
ronnie
had
decided
not
to
believe
any
of
them
i
d
sure
like
to
get
inside
bill
repeated
the
old
office
stood
back
from
the
cobblestone
road
two
giant
sentinel
pines
towered
over
the
roof
dwarfing
the
building
and
the
sapling
hemlocks
and
pines
that
crowded
close
to
its
sides
race
you
to
it
bill
yelled
suddenly
and
started
down
the
narrow
path
from
the
cobbled
road
ronnie
knew
he
couldn
t
outrun
bill
with
his
longer
legs
but
he
d
sure
try
anyway
gasping
for
breath
ronnie
reached
his
friend
who
had
dropped
to
the
ground
and
stretched
himself
out
in
a
nest
of
last
year
s
leaves
just
in
front
of
the
padlocked
door
ronnie
threw
himself
down
beside
bill
they
lay
there
for
a
few
minutes
catching
their
breaths
then
bill
got
up
and
began
to
hunt
around
on
the
ground
he
found
a
rock
and
brought
it
over
to
the
door
what
are
you
aiming
to
do
ronnie
asked
i
can
smash
that
lock
easy
bill
answered
ronnie
pulled
himself
to
his
feet
forget
it
we
were
going
to
climb
to
the
roof
and
look
down
the
chimney
at
the
swift
s
nest
remember
bill
looked
at
the
stone
in
his
hand
and
then
into
ronnie
s
face
o
k
he
said
letting
the
rock
drop
to
the
ground
some
other
time
maybe
but
by
golly
i
sure
want
to
see
what
s
inside
grandfather
said
there
s
nothing
much
and
he
knows
because
he
s
hunted
through
everything
bill
had
shinnied
up
a
young
sapling
and
was
pulling
himself
carefully
onto
the
roof
what
was
he
looking
for
he
grunted
ronnie
started
up
after
him
and
by
the
time
he
reached
bill
s
side
he
had
conveniently
forgotten
to
answer
the
question
they
mounted
the
slope
together
and
then
edged
their
way
down
the
other
side
where
the
chimney
was
located
bill
had
no
trouble
peering
down
into
the
chimney
flue
but
ronnie
had
to
stand
on
his
toes
to
do
it
see
anything
ronnie
asked
i
can
make
out
the
nest
see
it
over
there
toward
the
back
i
think
there
are
eggs
in
it
yes
ronnie
agreed
looks
like
three
of
them
they
watched
for
a
minute
or
two
more
and
then
lost
interest
instead
they
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
roof
with
their
legs
hanging
dangerously
over
the
side
off
in
the
distance
ronnie
could
see
a
stretch
of
the
st
lawrence
river
and
a
smudge
of
smoke
from
a
river
boat
now
already
out
of
sight
a
man
from
the
seaway
s
at
the
house
talking
with
dad
and
grandfather
he
said
suddenly
the
seaway
s
dickering
with
my
pa
too
bill
said
pa
says
it
s
the
best
thing
that
ever
came
to
him
they
re
going
to
pay
him
five
hundred
dollars
an
acre
and
most
of
it
s
no
good
swamp
land
course
it
s
different
with
you
ronnie
i
know
it
s
the
village
that
s
going
i
wish
there
was
something
i
could
do
pa
says
there
s
not
a
chance
i
know
grandfather
won
t
say
it
but
he
knows
he
s
licked
sure
is
a
shame
because
they
don
t
really
need
that
part
where
the
village
is
not
for
the
main
steamship
lanes
anyway
but
just
because
it
s
bottom
land
and
will
flood
up
it
s
got
to
go
goose
brook
will
be
swallowed
up
too
too
bad
your
great
great
grandfather
didn
t
build
the
village
on
high
ground
but
then
i
guess
they
used
the
stream
for
power
to
turn
the
wheels
for
the
gristmill
ronnie
nodded
i
sure
as
shooting
wish
i
could
just
pile
up
a
heap
of
ground
along
the
river
to
keep
the
water
out
then
they
wouldn
t
want
the
village
land
he
was
looking
at
the
narrow
gap
where
goose
brook
tumbled
between
the
two
bluffs
that
formed
the
margins
of
the
valley
why
it
wasn
t
more
than
seventy
five
or
a
hundred
feet
across
and
if
it
were
filled
in
the
water
behind
the
new
seaway
dam
could
rise
as
high
as
it
needed
to
without
flooding
the
valley
ronnie
almost
lost
his
balance
and
plunged
over
the
edge
as
the
thought
struck
him
wow
he
exclaimed
i
ve
just
gotten
the
coolest
idea
you
ever
did
hear
of
now
why
in
the
name
of
common
sense
didn
t
i
think
of
it
sooner
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
bill
answered
seeing
i
haven
t
got
the
slightest
idea
of
what
you
re
talking
about
well
come
on
and
i
ll
show
you
ronnie
exploded
then
he
scrambled
up
the
roof
and
back
over
the
other
side
and
swung
himself
into
the
sapling
like
a
monkey
let
out
of
its
cage
chapter
ronnie
was
so
busy
telling
bill
about
his
idea
and
bill
was
listening
to
it
so
intently
that
neither
of
the
boys
saw
the
station
wagon
until
it
was
almost
upon
them
and
if
we
could
build
a
dam
across
that
narrow
gap
the
village
could
be
saved
ronnie
was
saying
it
was
bill
who
saw
the
station
wagon
first
and
he
stopped
dead
in
his
tracks
look
ronnie
he
exclaimed
a
car
in
here
there
was
an
old
dirt
road
leading
from
the
highway
and
connecting
with
the
cobblestone
road
but
neither
of
the
boys
could
ever
remember
seeing
it
used
but
now
that
ronnie
thought
about
it
there
wasn
t
any
reason
why
it
couldn
t
be
used
if
someone
had
a
mind
to
get
to
the
village
without
walking
someone
traveling
along
the
highway
that
is
and
here
apparently
was
someone
who
wanted
to
do
just
that
the
man
stopped
the
car
turned
off
the
engine
and
stepped
out
he
came
toward
the
boys
smiling
broadly
you
don
t
know
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
i
thought
sure
i
was
lost
and
the
road
was
too
narrow
to
turn
around
and
go
back
to
the
highway
he
took
a
step
toward
ronnie
offering
his
hand
my
name
s
caldwell
he
said
joseph
caldwell
ronnie
shook
hands
i
m
ronnie
and
this
here
s
bill
you
looking
for
something
special
mister
yes
the
old
rorth
glassworks
you
ve
found
it
bill
answered
but
there
s
nothing
here
any
more
mr
caldwell
ronnie
added
quickly
i
mean
they
don
t
make
glass
now
not
for
the
last
seventy
five
or
eighty
years
near
abouts
i
know
the
man
smiled
faintly
anybody
who
s
traveled
up
that
dirt
road
could
guess
that
there
s
been
no
activity
here
for
years
ronnie
grinned
now
that
you
re
here
what
are
you
fixing
to
do
he
asked
well
what
i
d
like
to
do
is
look
the
place
over
but
i
suppose
i
ll
have
to
get
permission
first
ronnie
shook
his
head
you
won
t
have
to
do
that
mr
caldwell
this
land
belongs
to
my
grandfather
he
ll
let
you
look
maybe
you
d
like
to
have
us
show
you
around
i
d
like
that
very
much
mr
caldwell
answered
as
ronnie
led
the
man
down
the
cobbled
street
a
hundred
stories
grandfather
had
told
him
about
the
village
leaped
to
his
mind
and
begged
to
be
told
he
remembered
the
evening
grandfather
and
he
had
sat
on
the
top
of
the
bluff
overlooking
the
village
with
the
bats
circling
overhead
and
the
buildings
standing
silent
below
and
fading
from
sight
among
the
trees
in
the
gathering
darkness
how
vividly
grandfather
had
told
the
story
of
the
great
fire
of
when
ten
of
the
workers
cottages
had
burned
to
the
ground
and
great
great
grandfather
ezra
had
worked
beside
his
men
battling
the
blaze
until
he
had
fallen
from
smoke
poisoning
or
the
winter
of
the
great
blizzard
when
the
roof
of
the
glassworks
had
caved
in
from
the
weight
and
when
the
drifts
were
so
high
it
took
three
days
to
dig
out
the
road
so
that
supplies
could
be
procured
from
the
storehouses
he
remembered
too
the
story
grandfather
told
about
the
duchess
from
bavaria
who
had
visited
the
works
because
she
admired
the
rorth
glassware
so
much
great
great
grandfather
had
blown
a
special
piece
for
her
that
day
and
she
in
turn
had
left
a
treasured
piece
of
bavarian
glass
they
approached
the
two
story
building
beside
goose
brook
this
was
the
gristmill
ronnie
told
mr
caldwell
every
bit
of
flour
and
meal
for
the
village
was
made
here
from
the
grain
grown
on
the
fields
up
above
where
dad
has
his
orchards
now
caldwell
inspected
the
huge
overshot
waterwheel
mounted
on
its
two
stone
and
cement
piers
and
connected
to
the
inside
of
the
building
with
a
rusty
shaft
by
which
the
power
was
transferred
to
the
grinding
stones
they
went
inside
a
musty
smell
of
damp
stone
and
stale
air
touched
ronnie
s
nostrils
the
large
grinding
stone
stood
motionless
now
big
copper
caldrons
and
stone
mixing
pots
gave
evidence
that
the
grain
had
not
only
been
ground
to
flour
but
baked
into
bread
as
well
a
massive
fireplace
with
an
iron
oven
on
each
side
formed
the
entire
rear
wall
caldwell
poked
about
among
the
smaller
articles
for
a
while
and
then
followed
the
boys
outside
next
they
visited
the
main
building
where
the
glass
had
been
made
and
blown
bill
showed
the
man
the
main
furnace
with
its
four
openings
into
the
main
chimney
which
rose
like
a
giant
above
the
furnace
and
disappeared
through
the
roof
some
of
the
long
handled
pots
in
which
the
glass
was
heated
were
still
stacked
against
the
wall
otherwise
the
building
was
bare
of
its
former
equipment
caldwell
led
the
way
outside
i
ve
got
time
for
more
if
you
have
he
announced
the
church
sawmill
and
a
few
of
the
workers
houses
which
were
still
intact
followed
then
came
a
quick
inspection
of
the
smith
shop
and
finally
the
old
office
all
boarded
up
and
locked
i
see
caldwell
commented
something
special
housed
inside
why
no
sir
ronnie
answered
he
didn
t
feel
like
giving
an
explanation
of
something
so
personal
that
even
grandfather
didn
t
like
to
talk
about
it
caldwell
didn
t
press
his
question
i
certainly
am
impressed
by
how
well
preserved
some
of
the
buildings
are
he
said
instead
that
s
because
grandfather
didn
t
want
to
see
the
village
fall
to
pieces
ronnie
answered
before
he
came
down
with
his
gout
he
spent
days
working
down
here
every
time
he
could
get
away
from
the
farm
he
told
me
for
a
while
he
even
milled
his
own
lumber
from
the
wood
lot
so
s
he
could
afford
to
do
it
your
grandfather
must
have
a
real
love
for
this
place
the
man
said
sincerely
i
reckon
it
s
just
about
the
biggest
thing
in
his
life
ronnie
was
going
to
add
and
mine
too
but
he
didn
t
because
caldwell
had
turned
away
and
had
started
down
the
path
toward
the
cobbled
road
grandpa
even
replaced
some
of
these
stones
in
the
old
roadbed
ronnie
added
as
the
three
headed
back
toward
mr
caldwell
s
car
he
handed
each
of
the
boys
a
quarter
you
ve
been
real
fine
guides
he
said
thank
you
for
taking
me
around
you
don
t
need
to
pay
us
mister
ronnie
said
handing
the
money
back
bill
and
i
we
would
have
hung
around
here
anyway
keep
it
please
the
man
insisted
who
knows
i
may
want
you
to
help
me
more
and
then
i
wouldn
t
feel
right
asking
you
would
i
all
right
ronnie
agreed
bill
had
already
pocketed
his
quarter
say
mr
caldwell
ronnie
had
an
idea
do
you
suppose
other
people
would
pay
money
to
have
us
show
them
around
mr
caldwell
thought
about
the
question
i
m
sure
you
could
attract
quite
a
few
interested
people
if
they
knew
about
it
he
opened
the
door
to
his
car
say
son
i
wonder
if
i
could
come
to
see
your
parents
tomorrow
and
your
grandfather
too
i
haven
t
got
any
mother
she
died
when
i
was
born
but
you
can
sure
come
to
see
dad
and
grandfather
something
you
want
maybe
well
perhaps
you
see
i
m
writing
a
book
about
early
american
glassware
and
an
idea
just
struck
me
that
might
prove
interesting
but
let
me
go
back
to
my
motel
and
think
it
over
and
i
ll
tell
you
about
it
tomorrow
when
i
visit
your
folks
suits
me
fine
ronnie
answered
caldwell
climbed
into
his
car
and
started
the
engine
ronnie
and
bill
watched
him
while
he
maneuvered
his
machine
about
on
the
narrow
cobbled
roadway
and
headed
in
the
opposite
direction
then
caldwell
leaned
from
the
window
and
waved
good
by
he
started
back
up
the
road
toward
the
highway
in
low
gear
bill
turned
to
ronnie
now
just
what
do
you
suppose
brought
him
here
to
see
the
village
in
the
first
place
he
couldn
t
have
stumbled
on
it
just
by
accident
that
s
for
sure
he
was
eying
the
locked
up
building
mighty
suspicious
like
i
ll
tell
you
that
ronnie
added
did
you
see
him
bill
bill
nodded
his
head
he
s
come
here
for
something
and
i
don
t
think
writing
a
book
is
the
whole
answer
they
walked
up
the
path
together
picking
up
old
acorns
and
shooting
them
into
the
trees
suddenly
bill
stopped
and
confronted
ronnie
how
come
you
asked
him
would
other
people
pay
money
to
see
the
village
ronnie
he
asked
i
was
putting
one
and
one
together
and
i
think
i
came
up
with
two
and
what
s
this
two
you
came
up
with
well
that
narrow
gap
where
goose
brook
comes
down
through
the
valley
plus
some
money
we
might
be
able
to
earn
this
summer
showing
people
around
maybe
it
equals
a
dam
and
saving
the
village
bill
thought
about
that
while
he
searched
the
dried
leaves
beneath
a
giant
bull
oak
for
more
ammunition
how
much
you
figure
a
dam
would
cost
ronnie
shrugged
i
haven
t
got
the
slightest
idea
a
hundred
dollars
maybe
bill
shook
his
head
maybe
more
like
a
thousand
maybe
ten
thousand
well
it
would
be
a
beginning
anyway
and
i
know
people
hereabouts
who
would
want
to
see
the
village
saved
too
and
i
ll
bet
if
they
heard
how
we
were
working
to
earn
money
maybe
they
d
help
out
too
my
dad
knows
the
president
of
the
historical
society
in
town
and
he
told
dad
he
was
sick
hearing
about
how
the
village
would
be
bulldozed
and
flooded
and
if
there
was
anything
the
society
could
do
to
help
he
should
just
speak
up
ronnie
sighed
i
d
sure
like
to
try
to
earn
the
money
to
save
the
village
it
would
be
fun
too
you
and
me
and
maybe
phil
if
he
wants
to
and
you
don
t
care
and
then
if
we
can
t
use
the
money
for
the
village
we
can
always
have
it
to
put
in
the
bank
let
s
try
it
huh
bill
ronnie
said
it
s
a
deal
rorth
and
beckney
guided
tours
of
the
rorth
glassworks
deserted
village
as
they
walked
together
down
the
path
each
of
the
boys
was
filled
with
ideas
as
to
how
they
would
proceed
there
would
have
to
be
a
sign
on
the
highway
of
course
and
the
road
leading
into
the
village
would
need
some
repairs
and
the
branches
overhanging
it
should
be
pruned
short
they
d
have
to
decide
upon
how
much
to
charge
and
what
they
d
tell
their
guests
about
each
of
the
buildings
they
stopped
where
the
path
divided
one
route
leading
toward
the
beckney
farm
the
other
up
the
embankment
to
the
rorth
orchard
tomorrow
bill
ronnie
asked
him
tomorrow
partner
bill
answered
ronnie
turned
and
began
to
run
digging
his
toes
into
the
embankment
as
he
scrambled
to
the
top
he
raced
through
the
apple
orchard
leaping
a
time
or
two
to
grab
at
a
pea
sized
apple
he
suddenly
felt
light
enough
to
fly
at
least
now
he
d
be
doing
something
to
save
the
deserted
village
not
just
standing
by
and
listening
to
grandfather
argue
with
mr
evans
chapter
when
ronnie
entered
the
house
he
was
whistling
a
tune
through
the
space
between
his
two
front
teeth
in
the
living
room
he
found
phil
sprawled
out
on
the
couch
with
his
head
propped
up
against
a
pillow
and
a
comic
book
in
his
hands
phil
turned
a
page
and
looked
up
at
ronnie
hi
he
said
where
ve
you
been
down
in
the
village
ronnie
went
over
to
dad
s
desk
to
see
if
there
might
be
some
important
looking
papers
as
a
result
of
the
meeting
that
afternoon
don
t
you
get
tired
of
lying
around
all
the
time
he
asked
phil
not
me
phil
shifted
his
position
it
ll
take
me
another
month
to
rest
up
from
a
year
of
school
what
re
you
looking
for
oh
nothing
maybe
a
deed
to
the
village
property
nothing
like
that
yet
gramp
s
lawyer
arrived
soon
after
you
got
booted
away
from
the
window
and
they
got
nowhere
from
then
on
how
d
you
know
what
happened
to
me
because
i
was
listening
from
the
other
side
from
the
hall
soon
s
the
lawyer
arrived
gramps
began
demanding
a
lot
more
money
for
the
property
than
the
seaway
wanted
to
give
and
they
argued
about
that
for
a
while
and
then
mr
evans
left
i
m
telling
you
all
this
because
i
know
you
re
going
to
ask
me
anyway
ronnie
nodded
sure
i
want
to
know
about
it
where
s
dad
out
in
the
barn
i
think
ronnie
turned
and
headed
for
the
kitchen
where
he
was
met
with
a
frown
from
mrs
butler
who
did
the
housework
and
prepared
the
meals
for
the
rorths
mrs
butler
was
a
huge
woman
with
a
heavy
set
jaw
and
a
sharp
straight
nose
and
piercing
eyes
that
darted
rapidly
from
one
place
to
another
now
don
t
you
be
running
off
somewhere
she
warned
ronnie
supper
s
nearly
ready
to
serve
up
and
if
it
s
like
usual
i
ll
have
to
hunt
the
four
corners
of
the
farm
to
find
everyone
yes
ma
am
i
mean
no
ma
am
if
you
re
going
out
back
take
a
look
at
the
gas
tank
for
me
will
you
i
don
t
think
it
s
been
exchanged
in
a
month
the
indicator
showed
the
tank
to
be
almost
half
full
ronnie
passed
this
information
on
to
mrs
butler
and
then
hurried
toward
the
barn
chasing
a
dozen
chickens
out
of
his
path
his
father
was
sitting
on
the
homemade
bicycle
propelled
grindstone
sharpening
one
of
the
blades
to
his
haymower
he
didn
t
look
up
from
his
work
as
ronnie
came
to
a
stop
at
his
side
and
stood
watching
him
want
me
to
spell
you
dad
ronnie
shouted
above
the
racket
mr
rorth
slowed
down
his
pumping
and
then
climbed
off
all
right
he
answered
i
m
on
the
last
one
but
my
legs
are
getting
tired
ronnie
climbed
onto
the
seat
and
started
turning
the
pedals
the
eight
inch
diameter
stone
began
to
whirl
sparks
shot
in
every
direction
as
mr
rorth
laid
the
edge
of
the
blade
against
the
stone
a
few
minutes
later
he
signaled
the
boy
to
stop
there
that
s
better
he
said
running
his
finger
cautiously
along
the
edge
of
the
blade
now
if
the
weather
holds
out
i
can
get
the
north
field
cut
and
maybe
into
the
loft
you
re
going
to
have
company
in
the
morning
dad
ronnie
said
now
who
s
coming
mr
rorth
sounded
annoyed
i
wasted
the
whole
afternoon
on
this
property
deal
when
i
should
have
been
haying
now
who
s
going
to
take
over
another
half
a
day
ronnie
sympathized
with
his
father
it
wasn
t
an
easy
job
teaching
agriculture
in
the
local
high
school
during
the
winter
and
then
trying
to
run
a
sixty
acre
farm
during
the
growing
season
ronnie
wanted
to
say
i
ll
give
you
a
hand
dad
but
he
couldn
t
summon
enough
will
power
to
do
it
because
he
was
looking
forward
so
eagerly
to
starting
his
business
venture
instead
he
answered
his
father
s
question
mr
caldwell
dad
caldwell
never
heard
of
him
me
neither
until
a
little
while
ago
he
came
driving
into
the
village
while
bill
and
i
were
there
and
he
asked
us
to
show
him
all
around
and
after
we
d
done
that
he
said
he
d
an
idea
he
wanted
to
see
you
about
you
and
grandfather
well
whatever
it
is
i
m
sure
grandfather
can
take
care
of
it
by
himself
mrs
butler
s
voice
bellowed
from
the
rear
door
come
and
get
it
come
and
get
it
before
i
throw
it
down
the
sink
mr
rorth
grinned
to
himself
nice
wholesome
creature
that
mrs
butler
but
heaven
knows
what
we
would
do
without
her
mr
rorth
wiped
his
hands
free
of
grease
and
started
toward
the
barnyard
door
ronnie
snapped
off
the
overhead
bulb
and
followed
dad
he
said
hurrying
to
catch
up
dad
if
you
need
me
with
the
haying
i
ll
help
mr
rorth
thought
it
over
i
guess
not
thanks
son
maybe
after
i
get
it
cut
you
can
help
load
the
truck
and
i
ll
probably
need
a
hand
getting
it
up
into
the
loft
the
same
as
last
week
ronnie
went
into
the
dining
room
to
wait
for
the
others
to
arrive
he
stood
in
front
of
the
sideboard
idly
tinkling
the
bullet
sized
glass
crystals
that
hung
in
a
circle
of
dewdrops
from
the
rim
of
one
of
the
rorth
candlesticks
a
ray
of
light
from
the
ceiling
chandelier
struck
one
of
the
crystals
and
a
rainbow
of
colors
danced
before
the
boy
s
eyes
grandfather
s
cane
came
thumping
into
the
room
and
stopped
behind
the
boy
you
watch
your
step
with
that
candlestick
grandfather
warned
doesn
t
pay
to
monkey
around
with
it
for
no
good
purpose
there
s
little
enough
of
the
old
rorth
glassware
left
in
the
world
and
those
two
candlesticks
are
the
prize
of
the
lot
i
won
t
harm
it
grandfather
i
know
i
know
i
ve
heard
you
say
that
before
with
disastrous
results
those
sticks
next
to
the
village
are
the
pride
of
my
life
now
you
wouldn
t
want
to
have
everything
taken
from
me
would
you
lad
no
grandfather
he
turned
away
from
the
sideboard
and
looked
up
at
his
grandfather
grandpa
he
said
dad
told
me
once
there
was
a
story
about
the
candlesticks
will
you
tell
me
about
it
dad
said
you
were
the
one
to
tell
me
if
i
was
to
know
grandfather
s
gray
eyes
twinkled
for
a
moment
remember
how
not
so
long
ago
you
used
to
come
sit
a
spell
in
my
room
after
supper
and
we
d
talk
about
the
village
and
about
your
great
great
grandfather
ezra
and
about
the
glassworks
ronnie
nodded
well
maybe
if
you
were
to
slip
in
for
a
while
tonight
we
could
talk
about
the
candlesticks
and
maybe
about
the
locked
up
building
too
huh
grandpa
the
old
man
frowned
that
s
best
forgotten
lad
best
forgotten
phil
was
already
seated
at
the
table
and
mrs
butler
was
glaring
in
ronnie
s
direction
warning
him
to
do
the
same
he
helped
grandfather
into
his
special
armchair
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
then
slipped
around
and
sat
down
next
to
phil
grandfather
said
grace
mrs
butler
brought
in
the
corned
beef
and
cabbage
and
mr
rorth
made
a
late
entrance
to
take
his
place
opposite
grandfather
mr
rorth
s
face
was
drawn
into
a
frown
i
wish
he
exclaimed
irritably
the
seaway
would
hurry
up
and
buy
the
land
so
i
could
get
on
with
the
farm
work
a
loud
snort
from
grandfather
warned
him
that
he
had
not
worded
his
feelings
in
quite
the
way
the
old
man
would
understand
what
i
mean
is
he
hurried
to
correct
himself
what
i
mean
is
that
we
haven
t
got
a
ghost
of
a
chance
of
saving
it
so
we
might
as
well
be
done
with
the
whole
thing
but
it
was
too
late
grandfather
had
already
risen
to
his
feet
his
hand
turning
white
as
he
clenched
the
handle
of
his
cane
his
face
was
a
fiery
red
against
his
snow
white
hair
and
the
vein
on
his
right
forehead
popped
from
the
surface
like
a
big
purple
knot
for
a
moment
he
was
so
angry
his
words
wouldn
t
come
out
straight
you
why
you
you
re
a
traitor
to
the
rorths
the
village
is
the
soul
the
heart
the
life
of
this
family
and
you
throw
it
away
in
a
few
idle
words
why
why
this
boy
here
he
pointed
to
ronnie
has
a
greater
appreciation
for
what
the
village
means
far
greater
i
can
t
understand
it
i
just
can
t
understand
it
he
sank
back
down
into
his
chair
breathing
rapidly
for
a
minute
there
wasn
t
a
sound
in
the
room
ronnie
could
hear
a
cricket
chirping
mournfully
in
the
cellar
then
his
father
looked
up
from
his
plate
i
m
sorry
he
said
to
grandfather
i
really
didn
t
mean
it
the
way
it
sounded
grandfather
grunted
but
said
nothing
after
supper
ronnie
and
phil
helped
mrs
butler
with
the
dishes
folks
down
in
town
are
mighty
sad
knowing
the
old
deserted
village
isn
t
to
be
spared
she
said
as
she
wrapped
up
some
of
the
table
scraps
to
take
home
to
her
cats
mighty
sad
it
s
surprising
how
many
folks
there
have
a
fond
spot
in
their
hearts
for
the
place
fact
is
there
s
talk
going
around
to
do
something
about
saving
it
if
there
s
a
way
to
get
it
done
ronnie
pricked
up
his
ears
at
this
gosh
do
you
think
they
can
well
i
ll
tell
you
boy
sometimes
public
opinion
is
powerful
strong
magic
when
it
comes
to
something
like
this
the
government
doesn
t
like
to
rouse
up
public
sentiments
if
they
can
help
it
there
was
a
lot
to
what
mrs
butler
had
said
and
ronnie
stored
the
information
away
for
later
use
maybe
a
combination
of
raising
money
for
the
dam
and
getting
the
townspeople
interested
might
just
turn
the
trick
now
more
than
ever
he
was
anxious
to
get
started
on
his
venture
mrs
butler
had
her
scraps
wrapped
and
turned
now
to
putting
away
the
dishes
phil
had
dried
you
know
she
said
either
i
m
getting
daffy
in
my
old
age
or
something
mighty
queer
s
going
on
around
here
how
come
mrs
butler
phil
asked
well
i
ll
let
you
figure
it
out
this
afternoon
i
put
a
blanket
out
on
the
line
to
air
a
little
while
ago
i
went
out
to
get
it
and
it
was
gone
i
even
got
a
flashlight
to
follow
the
line
down
to
the
barn
thinking
maybe
i
d
put
that
blanket
farther
away
from
the
house
than
i
d
figured
and
it
wasn
t
there
phil
asked
nowheres
about
not
even
on
the
ground
figuring
maybe
the
wind
might
have
taken
it
if
there
d
been
a
wind
asked
your
pa
asked
your
grandpa
if
they
d
taken
it
golly
that
is
strange
ronnie
agreed
some
tramp
probably
mrs
butler
grumbled
going
to
the
closet
to
get
her
coat
but
something
in
her
voice
told
ronnie
she
didn
t
believe
it
chapter
after
mrs
butler
had
left
ronnie
headed
for
the
sunny
room
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
back
wing
of
the
house
there
he
found
grandfather
seated
in
his
morris
chair
working
frantically
at
the
dials
of
his
radio
transmitter
confounded
sunspots
the
old
man
growled
i
just
can
t
seem
to
make
contact
with
donavon
tonight
maybe
he
s
not
home
now
that
s
as
foolish
an
explanation
as
i
ve
ever
heard
of
course
he
s
home
he
s
been
home
every
night
for
the
past
two
years
all
ready
to
give
me
his
next
move
and
hope
like
the
devil
that
he
s
got
me
stymied
ronnie
looked
over
at
the
table
beside
the
transmitter
where
grandfather
had
his
chess
set
it
was
a
beautiful
board
of
alternating
light
and
dark
squares
of
imported
inlaid
woods
the
chessmen
themselves
were
large
and
ornate
and
handsomely
carved
from
the
best
ivory
the
crackle
in
the
loudspeaker
was
suddenly
broken
by
albert
donavon
s
voice
in
detroit
w
x
z
calling
w
n
l
come
in
w
n
l
why
in
blazes
are
you
telling
me
to
come
in
you
old
fogy
grandfather
retorted
i
ve
been
trying
to
raise
you
for
the
past
ten
minutes
what
s
the
matter
you
afraid
i
m
going
to
check
you
with
my
next
move
there
isn
t
a
move
in
the
books
you
could
check
me
with
donavon
returned
they
chatted
for
a
few
minutes
about
the
weather
and
each
other
s
health
and
then
exchanged
their
moves
move
my
castle
to
white
s
king
rook
file
third
rank
grandfather
told
him
and
then
sweat
that
one
out
why
you
old
buzzard
donavon
came
back
you
think
that
s
going
to
help
you
wait
until
you
see
what
i
ve
got
in
store
for
you
move
my
queen
s
bishop
to
the
king
knight
s
file
fifth
rank
now
figure
that
out
if
you
can
ha
grandfather
was
indignant
you
ll
have
to
get
up
early
in
the
morning
to
find
a
move
that
i
can
t
figure
out
your
trouble
always
has
been
that
you
jump
to
too
hasty
conclusions
donavon
but
grandfather
looked
worried
ronnie
noticed
he
was
studying
the
board
and
frowning
see
you
tomorrow
night
same
time
donavon
signed
off
and
the
loudspeaker
went
dead
then
grandfather
turned
off
his
transmitter
and
receiver
thinks
he
has
me
cornered
does
he
well
let
him
figure
out
that
move
i
gave
him
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
ronnie
he
said
it
s
nice
having
you
back
in
here
with
me
like
old
times
i
ve
been
fearing
that
maybe
you
and
i
were
drifting
apart
of
late
he
closed
his
eyes
for
a
few
moments
and
leaned
his
head
back
against
his
chair
so
many
things
have
been
slipping
from
me
these
past
weeks
so
many
things
he
opened
his
eyes
again
and
looked
at
ronnie
you
aren
t
going
to
slip
from
me
too
are
you
boy
of
course
not
gramps
it
s
because
you
ve
been
worried
about
the
village
and
i
didn
t
want
to
pester
you
ronnie
explained
that
s
why
i
haven
t
been
coming
in
here
to
see
you
so
much
lately
of
course
and
you
ve
been
worried
too
grandfather
added
why
it
s
been
written
all
over
you
you
wouldn
t
be
my
boy
if
you
weren
t
worrying
about
the
village
he
stretched
out
his
game
leg
to
ease
some
of
the
pain
you
won
t
be
forgetting
the
wonderful
times
we
had
together
in
the
village
now
will
you
boy
no
sir
gramps
ronnie
exclaimed
why
just
this
afternoon
i
was
telling
mr
caldwell
some
of
the
stories
you
told
me
caldwell
i
don
t
recall
that
name
ronnie
explained
to
grandfather
how
caldwell
had
driven
into
the
village
and
how
bill
and
he
had
taken
the
man
on
a
tour
of
the
buildings
and
he
gave
me
and
bill
a
swell
idea
gramps
we
re
going
to
make
money
so
we
can
build
a
dam
across
that
pass
where
goose
brook
comes
through
and
then
they
won
t
have
to
flood
the
valley
and
say
hold
on
there
a
minute
boy
you
re
going
faster
than
a
runaway
locomotive
down
a
steep
grade
and
i
lost
you
a
ways
back
now
just
how
are
you
going
to
make
this
money
and
what
pass
are
you
going
to
dam
up
this
all
sounds
pretty
fantastic
to
me
but
by
the
time
ronnie
had
finished
explaining
his
plans
grandfather
was
nodding
his
head
slowly
and
puckering
his
lips
the
way
he
did
when
he
was
almost
convinced
there
s
a
chance
there
s
a
chance
he
kept
repeating
i
know
the
spot
you
mean
it
would
take
a
lot
of
fill
but
it
s
not
impossible
and
with
folks
in
town
stirring
things
up
for
the
seaway
it
might
come
about
of
course
you
realize
you
couldn
t
raise
near
enough
money
yourself
to
do
the
job
don
t
you
maybe
not
grandpa
but
somebody
s
got
to
start
things
going
you
never
said
a
truer
word
boy
you
ve
got
my
blessings
go
to
it
and
don
t
forget
just
because
i
ve
got
a
leg
here
that
won
t
do
its
job
any
longer
doesn
t
mean
i
can
t
help
there
s
one
thing
i
got
plenty
of
advice
ronnie
smiled
up
at
his
grandfather
we
ll
lick
this
yet
won
t
we
gramps
and
now
will
you
tell
me
about
the
candlesticks
the
old
man
nodded
then
frowned
now
where
in
tarnation
do
i
begin
a
story
like
this
well
let
s
begin
with
your
great
great
grandfather
ezra
rorth
he
was
the
son
of
the
man
who
founded
the
glassworks
down
in
the
valley
but
it
was
really
ezra
who
built
it
up
so
that
it
was
known
practically
around
the
world
for
its
fine
glass
i
reckon
ezra
was
a
real
craftsman
an
artist
in
his
trade
he
had
a
habit
so
i
hear
of
rarely
duplicating
what
he
once
had
made
well
now
this
ezra
for
some
reason
nobody
s
ever
been
able
to
figure
out
took
in
a
partner
a
man
by
the
name
of
jacob
williams
seems
like
both
these
men
fell
in
love
about
the
same
time
and
got
themselves
engaged
then
they
decided
to
hold
a
double
wedding
ceremony
old
ezra
about
that
time
got
the
idea
he
and
jacob
ought
to
give
their
brides
to
be
something
extra
special
for
a
wedding
present
so
the
two
went
off
for
three
four
days
into
the
glassworks
and
shut
themselves
up
and
said
they
didn
t
want
anybody
busting
in
and
bothering
them
for
any
reason
at
all
when
they
came
out
they
d
created
two
pairs
of
those
candlesticks
one
pair
for
each
bride
those
in
the
dining
room
came
right
down
the
family
tree
from
generation
to
generation
i
gave
them
to
your
grandmother
and
when
your
dad
got
married
he
gave
them
to
your
mother
it
s
your
turn
next
seeing
you
re
the
oldest
me
ronnie
blushed
i
m
never
going
to
get
married
not
on
your
life
grandfather
roared
with
laughter
you
ll
sing
a
different
tune
in
another
ten
years
maybe
sooner
no
sir
i
m
going
to
stick
around
and
take
care
of
you
grandfather
well
that
s
mighty
nice
of
you
to
say
lad
tarnation
you
don
t
know
how
sad
this
whole
affair
with
the
village
has
made
me
and
your
father
isn
t
showing
the
fighting
spirit
i
expected
of
him
so
it
s
good
to
hear
you
say
nice
things
like
that
dad
really
is
fighting
grandpa
i
know
he
is
in
his
own
sort
of
way
well
maybe
so
and
i
m
sure
sorry
i
lost
my
temper
like
i
did
at
the
table
always
was
one
for
blowing
off
steam
and
then
feeling
sorry
about
it
afterward
i
m
glad
that
s
one
trait
you
didn
t
inherit
from
me
ronnie
got
up
stretching
and
then
started
for
the
door
gramps
he
said
turning
about
suddenly
you
ll
tell
me
about
the
boarded
up
building
too
won
t
you
grandfather
s
eyes
came
closed
wearily
as
if
he
were
trying
to
shut
out
thoughts
of
the
building
no
boy
he
answered
finally
his
eyes
still
closed
let
s
let
its
secret
die
along
with
me
i
searched
the
place
timber
to
timber
but
i
found
nothing
she
s
stubborn
that
building
just
like
some
of
the
rorths
i
guess
she
s
old
and
set
in
her
ways
and
if
she
won
t
tell
me
what
happened
she
won
t
tell
anybody
she
likes
me
grandfather
i
know
she
does
i
ve
sat
on
the
roof
lots
of
times
and
listened
to
the
swifts
down
in
her
chimney
and
i
m
sure
she
was
telling
me
to
look
but
i
don
t
know
what
to
look
for
grandfather
s
eyes
were
open
again
and
he
was
smiling
you
re
a
clever
rascal
you
are
boy
trying
to
touch
my
sentiments
are
you
well
i
ve
made
up
my
mind
the
secret
s
to
die
with
me
so
there
s
no
use
in
your
pestering
further
oh
all
right
but
i
think
it
s
a
shame
letting
the
secret
get
buried
under
all
that
water
grandfather
s
smile
faded
and
his
face
grew
flushed
and
the
vein
on
his
temple
began
to
swell
and
turn
purple
he
started
to
rise
too
but
suddenly
changed
his
mind
and
sank
back
down
and
rested
his
head
back
against
the
chair
i
won
t
get
tempered
over
it
again
he
said
more
to
himself
than
ronnie
but
don
t
you
go
talking
like
that
any
more
remember
always
keep
thinking
the
best
is
going
to
happen
i
really
do
believe
that
gramps
i
was
just
saying
what
i
did
because
i
hoped
you
d
change
your
mind
and
tell
me
the
secret
well
i
ll
think
on
it
i
ll
think
on
it
maybe
i
ll
decide
to
tell
you
but
don
t
bother
me
about
it
any
more
you
hear
yes
gramps
all
right
now
go
on
and
get
out
of
here
i
m
tired
and
i
m
going
to
bed
ronnie
was
tired
too
but
he
stopped
in
the
dining
room
on
his
way
upstairs
to
take
another
look
at
the
candlesticks
they
were
beautiful
twelve
cut
glass
diamond
shaped
crystals
hung
by
spun
glass
chains
in
a
circle
from
the
rim
of
the
candle
holder
the
base
and
stick
itself
were
of
solid
frosted
glass
embellished
with
intricate
designs
of
rose
and
turquoise
embossing
he
set
one
of
the
crystals
in
motion
and
it
tinkled
like
a
bell
against
its
neighbor
crystal
he
climbed
the
stairs
to
the
upstairs
hall
phil
was
in
his
own
room
working
at
his
desk
ronnie
poked
his
head
inside
and
watched
his
brother
cutting
out
baseball
players
pictures
from
the
backs
of
cereal
boxes
he
had
been
accumulating
bill
and
i
are
starting
a
business
in
the
morning
you
can
come
in
with
us
if
you
want
what
kind
of
a
business
if
it
s
work
you
can
count
me
out
ronnie
explained
what
they
had
in
mind
phil
seemed
interested
i
ll
sleep
on
it
he
told
ronnie
and
went
on
with
his
work
ronnie
moved
down
the
hall
and
entered
his
own
room
he
didn
t
turn
on
the
light
but
instead
went
to
the
window
and
brushing
back
the
curtains
stared
out
into
the
blackness
the
moon
was
at
the
quarter
but
there
was
enough
light
from
it
to
light
up
patches
of
the
st
lawrence
river
so
that
it
looked
like
stretches
of
a
concrete
highway
cutting
through
the
darkness
below
and
a
little
to
the
left
the
night
was
blackest
and
here
ronnie
located
the
deserted
village
for
a
moment
he
thought
he
could
picture
the
black
inky
water
covering
the
land
as
the
floodwaters
rose
behind
the
proposed
dam
the
thought
of
such
a
thing
happening
sent
his
stomach
sinking
then
suddenly
his
eyes
widened
he
blinked
a
few
times
to
make
sure
he
wasn
t
seeing
something
that
wasn
t
there
it
was
there
all
right
directly
in
the
center
of
the
black
patch
of
night
where
he
had
located
the
village
a
halo
of
light
lay
shimmering
over
the
roof
of
one
of
the
buildings
it
moved
a
little
to
the
left
then
shifted
back
again
slowly
faded
slightly
and
brightened
again
ronnie
rubbed
at
the
windowpane
to
clear
the
glass
but
he
couldn
t
erase
the
light
he
had
seen
not
for
another
minute
or
two
anyway
then
it
disappeared
as
suddenly
as
it
had
appeared
chapter
ronnie
was
up
bright
and
early
the
next
morning
all
the
time
he
was
washing
himself
and
brushing
his
teeth
he
was
trying
to
figure
out
what
it
was
he
had
seen
the
night
before
it
had
looked
somewhat
like
a
flashlight
beam
hitting
the
thick
foliage
from
underneath
a
tree
but
that
wouldn
t
account
for
the
way
the
light
had
reflected
from
the
sloping
roof
surface
of
one
of
the
buildings
i
reckon
that
was
just
about
where
the
boarded
up
building
is
he
told
himself
he
wondered
if
he
should
tell
anybody
about
what
he
had
seen
nobody
was
likely
to
believe
him
in
fact
he
was
having
a
hard
job
trying
to
convince
himself
that
his
eyes
hadn
t
been
playing
tricks
on
him
sometimes
the
netting
in
the
screens
made
lights
take
on
strange
shapes
and
do
crazy
things
or
maybe
it
was
the
moon
coming
out
suddenly
from
behind
a
cloud
and
lighting
up
the
roof
of
the
building
yet
this
wasn
t
the
first
time
he
had
gazed
out
over
the
deserted
village
from
his
bedroom
window
and
he
had
never
seen
the
light
before
he
pulled
on
his
trousers
and
went
down
to
the
kitchen
where
he
found
his
father
at
the
table
finishing
a
bowl
of
cold
cereal
morning
dad
he
said
morning
ronnie
what
s
the
special
occasion
getting
up
so
early
i
mean
the
boy
explained
about
the
plan
bill
and
he
had
made
how
they
hoped
to
attract
tourists
to
the
deserted
village
and
perhaps
earn
some
money
too
sounds
like
a
fine
idea
to
me
son
mr
rorth
nodded
his
head
let
me
know
if
i
can
help
you
in
any
way
mr
rorth
washed
his
dish
out
at
the
sink
and
set
it
into
the
drain
to
dry
a
fine
day
for
haying
he
said
glancing
out
the
window
at
the
sky
in
a
few
days
i
ll
need
you
and
phil
to
help
gather
it
in
after
his
father
had
left
ronnie
got
his
breakfast
of
fruit
juice
and
cereal
from
the
refrigerator
and
pantry
shelf
and
then
sat
down
at
the
table
to
eat
while
he
was
eating
he
thought
over
all
the
things
bill
and
he
would
do
that
day
to
prepare
for
their
new
business
venture
he
jotted
them
down
on
a
piece
of
scrap
paper
clean
out
all
the
buildings
that
are
in
pretty
good
shape
cut
off
all
the
branches
that
stick
out
over
the
dirt
road
and
the
cobblestone
road
clear
a
small
parking
place
print
a
sign
to
put
on
the
highway
then
he
added
tell
bill
what
i
saw
last
night
he
added
two
more
question
marks
at
the
end
of
the
words
just
as
ronnie
was
finishing
his
meal
he
heard
mrs
butler
drive
up
in
her
car
a
few
minutes
later
she
came
bustling
into
the
kitchen
well
she
exclaimed
aren
t
you
the
early
bird
she
opened
the
cupboard
door
and
placed
her
pocketbook
inside
strangest
thing
about
that
blanket
she
said
to
ronnie
i
was
sure
i
d
find
it
this
morning
but
i
don
t
see
hide
nor
hair
of
it
did
you
make
your
bed
youngster
ronnie
flushed
no
ma
am
he
confessed
i
might
have
guessed
well
i
ll
take
care
of
it
for
you
this
once
pears
like
you
ve
got
some
mighty
important
things
on
your
mind
or
you
wouldn
t
be
up
so
early
keep
your
eyes
peeled
for
that
blanket
she
picked
up
the
carpet
sweeper
from
beside
the
refrigerator
and
hurried
from
the
room
phil
shuffled
into
the
kitchen
still
in
his
pajamas
he
fell
into
a
chair
and
yawned
deeply
that
cereal
looks
o
k
mind
fixing
me
up
a
batch
help
yourself
be
my
guest
another
idea
had
come
to
ronnie
and
he
jotted
it
down
on
his
list
maybe
make
some
circulars
to
leave
around
town
telling
about
the
village
lots
of
tourists
came
through
massena
on
their
way
to
the
thousand
islands
some
might
be
interested
in
seeing
the
old
glassworks
phil
settled
himself
at
the
table
with
a
bowl
of
corn
flakes
and
a
bottle
of
milk
watcha
writing
he
asked
his
brother
just
jotting
down
some
ideas
about
starting
our
business
maybe
i
ll
tag
along
and
see
what
it
s
all
about
if
it
looks
interesting
i
ll
think
about
joining
up
don
t
put
yourself
out
aw
i
don
t
mind
in
fact
it
sounds
kind
of
intriguing
maybe
i
can
pick
up
a
few
fast
bucks
to
get
that
bicycle
i
ve
had
my
eye
on
ronnie
put
down
the
pencil
folded
up
the
paper
and
stuffed
it
in
his
trouser
pocket
all
the
money
we
make
is
going
into
helping
to
save
the
village
if
you
want
to
come
you
d
better
get
dressed
because
i
m
taking
off
in
a
few
minutes
you
can
go
on
ahead
i
ll
join
you
later
ronnie
washed
out
his
plate
and
glass
and
put
them
away
then
he
left
the
house
the
sun
was
hardly
over
the
treetops
and
the
grass
still
sparkled
with
early
morning
dew
a
fine
haze
streaked
the
horizon
and
the
boy
knew
it
was
going
to
be
hot
before
the
day
was
over
he
cut
through
the
orchard
slid
down
the
embankment
and
cut
into
the
forest
where
the
buildings
of
the
village
were
scattered
on
the
cobbled
road
he
paused
and
whistled
shrilly
a
signal
to
bill
he
listened
but
no
answer
came
back
to
him
well
he
d
wait
for
bill
by
the
boarded
up
house
he
cut
down
the
side
path
to
the
building
the
bare
earth
where
the
leaves
had
blown
away
was
damp
from
the
night
dew
and
his
bare
feet
padded
noiselessly
along
he
broke
out
into
the
small
clearing
that
faced
the
front
of
the
building
and
stopped
abruptly
for
a
second
he
had
thought
the
figure
moving
hurriedly
away
from
the
rear
of
the
building
was
bill
and
he
had
been
just
about
to
whistle
a
greeting
now
he
saw
that
it
was
a
man
and
while
he
could
only
see
a
portion
of
his
shoulders
and
head
he
thought
of
mr
caldwell
the
man
who
had
driven
into
the
village
the
day
before
hi
mr
caldwell
he
yelled
the
man
turned
for
an
instant
to
face
the
boy
then
whirled
about
and
hurried
into
the
woods
the
man
s
face
had
been
in
the
shadows
for
that
single
instant
he
had
faced
ronnie
and
the
boy
still
wasn
t
sure
whether
he
was
the
man
who
had
paid
them
the
visit
and
promised
to
return
for
a
talk
with
mr
rorth
ronnie
shrugged
as
if
to
tell
himself
that
it
really
didn
t
matter
if
it
had
been
caldwell
he
d
explain
his
actions
later
ronnie
decided
to
take
a
quick
swing
around
the
building
to
see
if
he
could
find
anything
that
might
tell
him
about
the
light
he
had
seen
the
evening
before
the
rusty
lock
snapped
in
place
three
or
four
years
before
when
grandfather
had
abandoned
his
search
was
still
in
place
the
window
shutters
were
as
tightly
closed
everything
looked
perfectly
normal
strangest
thing
ever
he
said
to
himself
he
was
beginning
to
believe
he
had
been
seeing
things
the
night
before
he
spied
a
narrow
crack
where
the
shutter
did
not
fit
tight
against
the
window
frame
but
it
was
a
little
too
high
to
look
through
but
off
in
one
of
the
thickets
of
hemlock
saplings
he
saw
a
fair
sized
log
he
grabbed
hold
of
it
rolled
it
over
beneath
the
window
and
then
wedged
a
smaller
piece
of
wood
under
it
to
keep
it
from
moving
holding
onto
the
window
frame
for
support
ronnie
climbed
onto
the
log
and
placed
his
right
eye
against
the
crack
the
room
was
dark
except
for
the
glow
from
a
faint
patch
of
light
that
found
its
way
down
the
chimney
flues
the
light
however
was
sufficient
for
him
to
make
a
very
puzzling
discovery
somebody
apparently
had
spent
the
night
sleeping
in
the
boarded
up
house
spread
out
on
the
hearth
was
mrs
butler
s
missing
blanket
the
stub
of
a
candle
was
waxed
securely
to
the
floor
and
a
flashlight
lay
to
one
side
hi
ronnie
he
heard
bill
s
voice
behind
him
gee
let
me
take
a
look
inside
too
ronnie
stepped
down
from
the
log
hi
bill
i
just
discovered
the
queerest
thing
you
take
a
look
and
tell
me
what
you
think
sure
thing
bill
was
only
too
happy
to
comply
he
climbed
the
log
and
shielding
his
eyes
peered
through
the
crack
a
minute
later
he
was
down
on
the
ground
again
facing
ronnie
looks
like
somebody
s
been
sleeping
in
there
he
exclaimed
just
what
i
thought
ronnie
agreed
and
that
looks
just
like
the
blanket
mrs
butler
lost
yesterday
i
know
it
because
it
s
the
one
she
uses
when
she
takes
her
nap
in
the
afternoon
i
d
know
that
indian
blanket
anywhere
well
let
s
go
in
and
take
a
look
around
bill
exclaimed
in
ronnie
was
flabbergasted
why
i
don
t
know
how
he
got
in
i
just
looked
at
the
lock
and
and
all
the
shutters
are
still
nailed
shut
i
think
couldn
t
be
bill
started
out
on
his
own
inspection
tour
he
joined
ronnie
a
few
minutes
later
shaking
his
head
in
disbelief
you
re
right
he
said
i
couldn
t
find
any
way
to
get
in
either
you
d
better
tell
your
dad
about
this
ronnie
i
ll
sure
do
that
he
said
and
maybe
your
grandfather
will
open
up
and
take
a
look
inside
to
find
out
what
s
going
on
yea
sure
ronnie
was
still
too
deep
in
thought
to
pay
much
attention
to
bill
s
remarks
how
had
the
intruder
gotten
in
he
asked
himself
over
and
over
again
mrs
butler
had
hung
the
blanket
on
the
line
the
day
before
and
now
ronnie
was
sure
that
it
was
inside
the
boarded
up
building
but
who
had
put
it
there
and
how
had
he
gotten
inside
the
boys
didn
t
give
up
searching
for
an
answer
until
they
had
re
examined
the
four
walls
and
had
even
climbed
to
the
roof
for
an
inspection
maybe
he
went
down
the
chimney
bill
suggested
don
t
be
silly
ronnie
laughed
even
a
baby
couldn
t
get
down
there
he
peered
over
the
top
and
looked
down
the
flue
besides
the
swifts
nest
is
still
there
and
it
would
be
broken
if
anyone
had
gone
down
just
then
bill
spied
phil
coming
down
the
cobblestone
road
hey
ron
nie
hey
bill
phil
called
out
don
t
let
on
what
we
ve
found
inside
bill
warned
ronnie
it
s
our
secret
yours
and
mine
o
k
ronnie
nodded
they
went
down
the
path
to
meet
phil
who
had
seated
himself
on
a
fallen
log
to
wait
for
them
to
join
him
he
had
cut
himself
a
walking
stick
from
a
wild
cherry
tree
and
was
busy
paring
ringlets
and
designs
by
stripping
off
the
bark
the
live
wood
showed
through
a
pale
green
thought
you
d
never
get
here
he
said
without
looking
up
from
his
work
how
s
the
business
coming
we
haven
t
started
yet
bill
turned
to
ronnie
i
was
thinking
last
night
that
first
off
we
ve
got
to
have
an
office
to
work
in
and
where
we
can
keep
all
our
stuff
that
s
right
ronnie
agreed
how
about
one
of
the
workers
cottages
phil
suggested
gramps
fixed
up
a
couple
of
them
and
they
re
still
in
good
shape
ronnie
and
bill
agreed
and
the
three
set
off
down
the
cobbled
road
crossed
goose
brook
and
struck
out
down
the
overgrown
path
that
led
to
the
row
of
workers
cottages
only
two
of
them
were
still
in
good
repair
the
two
on
each
end
of
the
row
that
formerly
contained
close
to
a
dozen
of
the
rest
most
had
completely
fallen
to
ruin
only
their
foundations
and
chimneys
were
still
standing
a
few
had
walls
but
the
roofs
were
caved
in
and
rotting
the
boys
chose
the
one
closest
to
the
cobbled
road
and
set
to
work
cleaning
it
up
while
ronnie
and
phil
removed
the
debris
that
littered
the
floor
bill
ran
home
to
get
a
broom
and
pail
and
mop
by
noontime
the
walls
and
floors
had
been
mopped
with
water
from
the
brook
a
makeshift
desk
had
been
constructed
from
old
lumber
and
several
rickety
but
serviceable
chairs
had
been
located
in
other
buildings
we
should
have
done
this
a
long
time
ago
bill
said
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
even
if
it
was
just
for
a
clubhouse
it
s
real
neat
before
leaving
for
lunch
they
agreed
to
return
that
afternoon
and
begin
work
on
some
of
the
items
ronnie
had
written
on
his
list
at
breakfast
that
morning
the
road
from
the
highway
comes
first
he
decided
then
cleaning
up
the
buildings
we
re
going
to
use
in
our
tour
then
the
sign
phil
groaned
i
just
remembered
he
announced
i
ve
got
a
date
with
the
hammock
for
the
afternoon
when
ronnie
came
within
sight
of
his
own
house
fifteen
minutes
later
he
recognized
mr
caldwell
s
station
wagon
parked
near
the
back
door
he
d
already
left
phil
a
good
distance
behind
so
he
began
to
run
afraid
that
he
might
already
have
missed
something
of
importance
mr
caldwell
was
in
the
barn
talking
with
ronnie
s
father
he
looked
up
and
smiled
in
the
boy
s
direction
as
ronnie
entered
hello
ronald
he
said
hi
ronnie
answered
ronnie
tagged
along
behind
his
father
and
mr
caldwell
as
they
walked
slowly
from
the
barn
and
then
stopped
alongside
mr
caldwell
s
car
for
a
few
final
words
then
mr
caldwell
climbed
into
his
station
wagon
and
started
the
engine
ronnie
waved
good
by
dad
he
asked
following
his
father
back
to
the
barn
what
did
he
want
supposing
you
come
up
in
the
loft
with
me
and
help
pile
up
the
hay
you
knocked
down
the
other
day
then
i
ll
be
able
to
get
the
rest
of
it
in
after
it
s
finished
drying
on
the
fields
i
ll
tell
you
about
mr
caldwell
while
we
work
ronnie
followed
his
father
up
the
ladder
it
was
stifling
hot
in
the
loft
mr
rorth
opened
the
two
loft
doors
that
faced
onto
the
barnyard
overhead
a
wasp
darted
angrily
among
the
beams
droning
like
a
model
airplane
mr
rorth
picked
up
two
pitchforks
and
handed
one
of
them
to
ronnie
how
come
you
re
so
interested
in
this
mr
caldwell
he
asked
starting
to
move
some
of
the
hay
toward
the
rear
of
the
loft
ronnie
grinned
i
guess
maybe
because
i
m
just
plain
nosey
he
answered
mr
rorth
had
gathered
up
a
large
pile
of
hay
now
he
jabbed
the
tines
of
his
fork
underneath
it
and
heaved
the
load
to
the
top
of
the
stack
then
he
turned
to
face
the
boy
couldn
t
ask
for
a
more
honest
answer
than
the
one
you
gave
me
could
i
he
queried
i
ll
say
this
though
about
the
man
he
went
on
more
seriously
i
ll
say
that
i
was
impressed
by
the
way
he
talked
he
seemed
genuinely
interested
in
antiques
particularly
glassware
and
apparently
he
s
built
up
quite
a
name
for
himself
as
a
connoisseur
of
old
glass
ronnie
thought
about
what
his
father
had
just
told
him
dad
what
s
a
connoisseur
a
connoisseur
well
he
s
a
person
who
knows
a
great
deal
about
some
special
art
subject
caldwell
got
interested
in
glassware
when
he
was
a
boy
it
seems
his
family
had
a
couple
of
pieces
of
rorth
glassware
that
had
been
handed
down
from
one
generation
to
the
next
he
started
doing
some
research
on
them
and
pretty
soon
he
was
studying
up
on
all
makes
of
glassware
now
he
s
writing
a
book
on
early
american
glassware
he
wants
to
include
a
few
chapters
about
rorth
glass
ronnie
stopped
work
long
enough
to
turn
toward
his
father
and
is
that
why
caldwell
came
to
see
you
he
asked
yes
in
a
way
mr
rorth
leaned
lightly
on
the
handle
of
his
fork
he
wants
to
spend
some
time
here
poking
around
in
the
buildings
and
talking
with
your
grandfather
about
the
history
of
the
glassworks
he
thought
maybe
he
could
bed
down
in
one
of
the
buildings
in
the
village
he
does
ronnie
exclaimed
golly
maybe
he
ll
help
us
set
up
our
business
specially
if
he
knows
so
much
about
glassware
think
he
might
dad
well
now
i
don
t
know
he
s
coming
here
to
learn
more
about
it
himself
but
you
ask
him
if
you
want
ronnie
went
over
to
the
opening
of
the
loft
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
with
his
feet
dangling
out
over
the
barnyard
the
perspiration
was
running
down
his
body
in
streams
and
he
wanted
to
cool
off
the
hayseeds
were
sticking
to
his
skin
too
and
itching
something
awful
his
father
came
over
and
stood
behind
him
leaning
on
the
handle
of
his
fork
trying
to
catch
a
few
puffs
of
the
cooler
air
when
s
he
moving
in
dad
ronnie
asked
right
after
lunch
i
think
he
went
back
to
check
out
of
the
motel
i
wonder
if
he
really
slept
in
the
motel
last
night
ronnie
mused
why
do
you
ask
that
because
somebody
slept
in
the
old
office
building
that
s
why
and
who
else
would
it
be
excepting
mr
caldwell
that
s
nonsense
ronnie
his
father
protested
why
would
mr
caldwell
want
to
sleep
in
the
old
office
building
and
how
would
he
get
in
without
breaking
down
the
door
that
s
what
bill
and
i
were
wondering
too
mr
rorth
shook
his
head
slowly
as
if
to
say
these
kids
and
then
picked
up
his
fork
and
moved
back
to
work
ronnie
got
up
and
followed
him
don
t
you
believe
me
dad
ronnie
asked
well
mr
rorth
said
grinning
i
ll
say
i
m
having
a
hard
time
believing
you
for
instance
how
can
you
tell
that
a
man
slept
there
what
evidence
do
you
have
well
there
s
a
little
crack
in
the
window
and
bill
and
i
climbed
up
and
looked
through
it
we
saw
the
blanket
mrs
butler
was
looking
for
last
night
mr
rorth
raised
his
eyebrows
a
bit
and
looked
straight
at
ronnie
well
that
is
convincing
he
thought
about
it
for
a
moment
tell
you
what
ronnie
i
m
going
down
to
the
village
later
this
afternoon
to
see
if
mr
caldwell
got
settled
all
right
i
ll
take
a
look
at
the
old
office
building
on
the
way
the
crack
is
in
the
south
window
and
you
can
peek
in
through
there
never
mind
the
crack
i
ll
bring
the
key
if
that
old
lock
will
still
turn
last
time
i
looked
it
was
wrapped
with
a
cloth
to
keep
it
from
rusting
not
any
more
it
isn
t
said
ronnie
after
lunch
ronnie
gathered
together
some
tools
and
lumber
to
use
in
building
a
sign
for
the
highway
with
these
under
his
arms
he
stopped
by
the
grape
arbor
where
phil
was
lying
in
the
hammock
you
coming
down
he
asked
hoping
he
would
so
he
could
carry
some
of
the
load
phil
eyed
the
lumber
and
tools
i
ll
be
down
after
my
siesta
he
said
nobody
with
any
sense
exercises
during
the
heat
of
the
day
by
resting
his
load
on
the
ground
every
few
hundred
feet
ronnie
reached
their
new
office
without
too
much
trouble
bill
hadn
t
shown
up
yet
so
ronnie
stretched
out
in
one
of
their
chairs
making
plans
for
the
afternoon
while
he
waited
for
his
friend
but
after
five
minutes
he
grew
restless
and
decided
he
d
kill
some
time
by
taking
another
peek
through
the
shutter
into
the
boarded
up
building
he
slipped
out
of
the
office
and
made
his
way
toward
the
building
soon
he
was
standing
on
the
log
and
peering
through
the
crack
oh
no
he
exclaimed
suddenly
now
what
s
dad
going
to
think
of
me
the
blanket
candle
and
flashlight
were
no
longer
in
sight
chapter
that
man
ronnie
told
himself
again
and
again
as
he
trudged
back
to
their
office
that
man
i
saw
this
morning
running
from
the
boarded
up
house
is
the
person
who
slept
in
there
last
night
and
that
man
had
looked
an
awful
lot
like
mr
caldwell
even
seen
from
a
distance
and
hidden
somewhat
by
the
early
morning
shadows
ronnie
groaned
he
sure
did
hate
the
thought
of
the
teasing
he
d
get
when
his
father
inspected
the
building
and
found
nothing
there
bill
was
waiting
for
him
when
he
reached
their
office
building
bout
time
you
got
here
he
said
i
ve
been
here
ronnie
retorted
i
went
over
to
take
another
peek
into
the
boarded
up
building
but
i
wished
i
hadn
t
how
come
ronnie
told
him
bill
groaned
too
i
told
my
pa
about
it
too
and
he
said
he
was
going
to
call
your
pa
on
the
telephone
somebody
s
made
a
monkey
out
of
us
for
sure
well
we
know
somebody
slept
there
last
night
ronnie
announced
stoutly
some
mighty
strange
things
are
going
on
around
here
let
me
tell
you
he
decided
to
break
down
and
tell
bill
about
the
peculiar
light
he
d
seen
the
evening
before
and
about
the
man
who
looked
like
mr
caldwell
who
had
turned
and
run
when
the
boy
had
shouted
his
name
bill
gave
a
long
loud
whistle
of
amazement
looks
like
we
ve
got
two
things
to
do
this
summer
save
the
village
and
solve
this
mystery
too
but
within
a
few
minutes
they
had
forgotten
the
mysterious
prowler
armed
with
the
pruning
sheers
and
sickle
that
bill
had
brought
with
him
they
started
clearing
the
overhanging
branches
from
both
sides
of
the
dirt
lane
a
half
hour
later
when
they
were
within
sight
of
the
main
road
mr
caldwell
s
station
wagon
turned
off
the
highway
and
came
toward
them
he
stopped
alongside
the
boys
and
poked
his
head
out
the
window
hop
in
and
i
ll
drive
you
back
in
that
is
if
you
re
finished
ronnie
nodded
and
the
two
climbed
into
the
front
seat
you
ve
done
a
fine
job
of
clearing
the
roadway
mr
caldwell
said
you
are
going
ahead
with
your
tourist
business
i
take
it
yes
ronnie
answered
how
did
you
know
about
it
your
father
told
me
mr
caldwell
swung
off
the
dirt
road
onto
the
cobblestones
now
the
question
is
which
building
shall
i
occupy
your
father
said
i
could
have
my
choice
how
about
one
of
the
workers
cottages
bill
suggested
we
re
using
one
of
them
for
our
office
but
there
s
a
real
good
one
with
a
fireplace
at
the
other
end
of
the
row
sounds
like
just
what
i
m
looking
for
caldwell
agreed
ronnie
and
bill
helped
mr
caldwell
unload
his
suitcases
and
cardboard
cartons
from
the
rear
of
the
station
wagon
and
carry
them
into
the
cottage
then
they
sat
on
the
floor
with
their
backs
against
a
wall
and
watched
him
unpack
just
about
that
time
mr
rorth
drove
up
in
his
pickup
truck
in
the
back
he
had
a
cot
and
mattress
blankets
and
sheets
a
table
and
a
few
chairs
as
well
as
some
cooking
utensils
these
should
make
you
comfortable
he
told
mr
caldwell
ronnie
walked
back
to
the
truck
beside
his
father
now
said
mr
rorth
let
s
take
a
look
at
the
evidence
of
this
mysterious
guest
we
re
supposed
to
be
harboring
in
the
old
office
building
ronnie
looked
up
sheepishly
at
his
father
it
s
not
there
any
more
dad
he
said
oh
so
the
ghost
picked
up
his
bedding
and
walked
away
eh
but
it
was
there
this
morning
dad
honest
it
was
bill
saw
it
too
he
ll
tell
you
mr
rorth
stared
at
his
son
a
moment
then
laughed
and
climbed
into
the
truck
ronnie
s
face
was
scarlet
as
he
turned
back
to
join
bill
for
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
the
boys
worked
at
cleaning
up
the
gristmill
and
the
general
store
phil
joined
them
about
three
o
clock
but
as
usual
he
wasn
t
much
help
twice
during
the
afternoon
they
took
a
breather
to
see
how
mr
caldwell
was
coming
with
his
unpacking
on
their
final
visit
ronnie
exclaimed
gosh
mr
caldwell
you
ve
got
this
place
looking
just
like
home
and
that
s
what
it
s
going
to
be
for
a
couple
of
weeks
who
knows
i
might
just
decide
to
stay
on
indefinitely
oh
but
you
couldn
t
do
that
not
unless
you
want
to
be
under
water
ronnie
explained
mr
caldwell
looked
at
ronnie
questioningly
not
knowing
whether
to
take
the
boy
s
remark
seriously
or
as
some
kind
of
joke
are
you
fooling
he
asked
oh
no
in
a
year
or
two
when
they
build
the
dams
on
the
st
lawrence
seaway
this
ll
all
be
under
water
gramps
is
furious
but
dad
says
he
can
t
do
anything
about
it
what
a
pity
what
a
great
pity
mr
caldwell
exclaimed
i
m
certainly
glad
i
decided
to
come
here
when
i
did
mr
caldwell
s
alarm
clock
showed
four
thirty
bill
suggested
that
they
start
work
cleaning
up
the
main
building
where
the
glass
had
been
manufactured
and
packed
we
ll
never
get
started
showing
people
around
at
the
rate
we
re
going
he
told
ronnie
and
phil
ronnie
of
course
didn
t
need
any
convincing
he
would
work
all
night
if
it
would
step
up
their
opening
date
phil
tagged
along
reluctantly
they
managed
to
cart
five
or
six
loads
of
the
larger
debris
from
the
building
and
dump
it
in
the
woods
out
of
sight
and
then
bill
announced
that
it
was
probably
time
for
him
to
get
home
he
had
chores
to
do
before
supper
and
so
did
ronnie
and
phil
they
walked
back
to
the
office
together
bill
wanted
to
gather
up
his
tools
to
take
home
i
ve
got
to
be
sure
to
get
these
back
he
explained
a
couple
of
nights
ago
a
saw
and
hammer
and
a
couple
of
other
tools
disappeared
from
the
barn
and
pa
insists
i
took
them
and
left
them
somewhere
we
haven
t
been
using
any
tools
like
that
ronnie
said
indignantly
they
walked
down
the
cobbled
road
to
where
their
paths
separated
you
know
bill
suggested
we
could
work
on
the
sign
tonight
and
leave
the
cleaning
up
for
the
daytime
think
you
could
get
away
for
a
while
after
supper
sure
said
ronnie
he
turned
to
his
brother
want
to
come
too
phil
phil
mumbled
something
about
a
television
show
when
ronnie
got
home
he
pitched
into
his
chores
immediately
he
chased
the
few
remaining
hens
into
the
chicken
house
filled
their
trough
with
water
and
fastened
the
door
shut
he
stabled
the
horse
and
then
watered
and
fed
her
then
he
went
into
the
house
to
collect
the
garbage
and
trash
to
take
to
the
dump
for
burning
returning
from
the
dump
he
caught
sight
of
his
father
driving
the
tractor
and
pulling
the
mowers
down
the
farm
road
from
the
fields
ronnie
cut
through
the
triangle
of
alder
bushes
to
meet
him
say
dad
he
asked
climbing
up
beside
him
could
i
go
back
down
to
the
village
after
supper
and
work
for
a
while
with
bill
we
re
going
to
make
our
sign
to
put
out
on
the
highway
i
don
t
see
why
not
you
pretty
near
ready
to
start
your
big
business
venture
just
about
i
guess
mr
rorth
nodded
his
head
in
approval
i
was
in
town
today
and
i
happened
to
run
into
steve
mercer
he
s
president
of
the
historical
society
told
me
that
they
d
written
a
letter
to
the
seaway
saying
their
society
s
violently
opposed
to
any
flooding
of
the
village
unless
it
s
absolutely
necessary
ronnie
s
heart
leaped
maybe
that
ll
help
us
get
permission
to
build
the
dam
across
the
top
of
the
valley
it
might
his
father
agreed
a
smile
tugged
at
his
lips
think
you
can
raise
that
kind
of
money
no
ronnie
said
honestly
but
it
ll
get
the
ball
rolling
and
that
s
what
counts
grandpa
says
and
of
course
he
s
right
mr
rorth
agreed
heaven
knows
i
want
to
see
the
village
spared
as
much
as
you
and
gramps
but
i
can
t
let
the
whole
farm
go
to
pieces
in
the
meantime
you
ve
got
to
be
practical
about
these
things
when
ronnie
reached
the
office
at
eight
o
clock
bill
was
waiting
for
him
bill
had
brought
a
kerosene
lantern
and
it
was
already
burning
when
ronnie
entered
the
door
outside
the
late
evening
shadows
were
deepening
among
the
trees
and
the
peepers
were
piping
down
in
the
marshes
along
the
river
pa
gave
me
a
piece
of
plywood
for
our
sign
bill
announced
and
i
brought
some
paint
and
brushes
they
sat
down
at
their
improvised
desk
and
composed
the
words
they
would
letter
on
the
sign
original
buildings
and
furnaces
of
one
of
america
s
renowned
glassworks
from
the
last
century
including
a
haunted
building
with
a
strange
history
complete
tour
adults
children
that
ought
to
get
their
curiosity
roused
up
bill
exclaimed
when
they
had
finished
now
let
s
get
it
laid
out
on
the
plywood
the
time
passed
quickly
for
the
two
outside
the
night
closed
in
among
the
old
buildings
and
the
silent
trees
now
that
looks
right
nice
bill
said
at
last
standing
back
to
survey
the
sign
looks
almost
like
a
real
sign
painter
made
it
tomorrow
first
thing
we
ll
get
it
up
on
the
road
ronnie
glanced
at
his
wrist
watch
i
d
best
be
getting
on
home
nothing
much
more
we
can
do
tonight
anyway
they
picked
up
their
flashlights
and
then
bill
blew
out
the
lantern
the
two
stepped
out
into
the
night
the
beams
from
the
flashlights
cut
a
solid
lane
down
the
path
as
they
made
their
way
toward
the
cobblestone
road
bill
was
in
the
lead
suddenly
he
stopped
and
pointed
off
into
the
trees
look
he
whispered
it
was
the
light
again
the
same
light
ronnie
had
seen
last
night
from
his
bedroom
window
now
that
it
was
closer
he
could
make
out
more
of
the
detail
at
first
glance
it
seemed
like
some
strange
unearthly
cloud
resting
motionless
over
the
top
of
the
building
but
ronnie
was
quick
to
discover
that
what
he
really
saw
was
the
light
striking
the
undersurface
of
the
thick
canopy
of
foliage
that
overhung
the
roof
setting
the
leaves
aglow
ronnie
moved
closer
to
his
friend
and
whispered
sure
looks
spooky
doesn
t
it
first
off
it
does
anyway
yea
bill
answered
sure
does
somebody
must
be
behind
the
building
pointing
a
flashlight
up
into
the
trees
ronnie
shook
his
head
whoever
s
doing
it
is
inside
the
building
poking
around
in
the
chimney
otherwise
you
d
see
the
light
in
a
circle
maybe
you
re
right
let
s
slip
over
and
take
a
peek
through
the
crack
in
the
shutter
i
m
with
you
boy
ronnie
answered
let
s
go
chapter
ronnie
shivered
the
shiver
started
at
his
shoulder
blades
traveled
down
his
spine
and
made
his
flesh
stand
out
in
goose
pimples
just
a
few
feet
ahead
almost
in
the
thick
blackness
that
lay
between
the
bushes
along
the
path
he
could
make
out
bill
s
light
colored
shirt
and
at
the
end
of
the
path
lay
the
padlocked
building
with
its
strange
halo
of
light
still
shimmering
in
the
foliage
over
the
roof
as
they
drew
closer
ronnie
could
see
that
the
light
did
come
from
the
chimney
as
he
had
suspected
somebody
poking
a
flashlight
around
in
the
chimney
flues
all
right
he
thought
but
why
was
it
just
a
trick
to
scare
bill
and
him
away
for
some
unknown
reason
or
was
this
intruder
searching
for
something
they
were
almost
to
the
building
when
the
light
went
out
and
the
blackness
closed
in
over
the
roof
ronnie
shivered
again
the
building
seemed
lonelier
and
more
desolate
than
it
had
before
bill
turned
about
and
came
close
to
ronnie
there
s
somebody
inside
for
sure
he
whispered
ronnie
could
feel
his
friend
s
breath
against
his
cheek
listen
i
can
hear
him
walking
around
ronnie
heard
the
sounds
too
floor
boards
creaking
under
the
intruder
s
weight
come
on
he
breathed
and
taking
his
friend
s
arm
steered
him
toward
the
side
of
the
building
the
log
was
still
in
place
below
the
window
ronnie
found
a
hold
on
the
window
frame
and
pulled
himself
up
he
leveled
his
eye
against
the
crack
and
peered
inside
only
a
small
portion
of
the
interior
came
within
his
view
and
the
intruder
whoever
he
was
was
out
of
range
but
a
portion
of
his
flashlight
beam
was
visible
and
lit
up
the
fireplace
and
the
hearth
before
it
then
the
light
shifted
suddenly
to
the
other
side
stayed
out
of
view
for
a
moment
and
then
returned
a
moment
later
the
light
went
out
completely
and
the
building
was
plunged
into
complete
blackness
ronnie
felt
bill
tugging
at
his
arm
i
hear
something
around
back
his
friend
warned
maybe
he
s
getting
out
but
there
s
no
way
out
through
the
back
ronnie
protested
hadn
t
bill
and
he
searched
every
square
foot
of
the
outside
of
the
building
but
then
the
intruder
had
to
enter
and
leave
the
building
somewhere
ronnie
stole
another
quick
look
through
the
crack
before
making
up
his
mind
the
interior
was
still
pitch
black
you
stay
here
and
watch
the
front
and
sides
he
directed
bill
i
ll
see
what
s
going
on
around
back
before
bill
could
protest
ronnie
had
dropped
from
the
log
and
was
making
his
way
toward
the
rear
of
the
building
it
wasn
t
easy
finding
a
way
through
the
thick
tangle
of
vines
and
bushes
but
he
didn
t
want
to
risk
giving
his
presence
away
by
turning
on
the
flashlight
he
rounded
the
corner
of
the
building
just
in
time
to
see
the
figure
of
a
man
step
back
away
from
the
rear
wall
of
the
old
office
for
a
moment
or
two
his
face
was
silhouetted
against
a
patch
of
sky
caldwell
ronnie
called
angrily
before
he
realized
what
a
foolish
thing
he
was
doing
the
man
s
hand
rose
a
brilliant
beam
of
light
struck
the
boy
full
in
the
face
blinding
him
instantly
then
the
light
went
out
and
the
man
sprang
away
into
the
darkness
burning
with
anger
and
disappointed
from
the
stupid
mistake
he
had
made
ronnie
leaped
wildly
after
him
and
plunged
into
the
undergrowth
he
had
taken
no
more
than
a
few
steps
when
he
tripped
over
a
log
and
hurtled
headlong
through
the
air
he
landed
with
a
jolt
in
a
tangle
of
briars
and
his
head
smashed
against
a
tree
trunk
whirling
lights
and
brilliant
flashes
stood
out
before
his
eyes
as
he
fought
for
consciousness
the
next
thing
he
knew
bill
was
standing
over
him
you
all
right
ronnie
bill
was
asking
ronnie
you
all
right
say
something
can
t
you
ronnie
struggled
to
sit
up
the
top
of
his
head
throbbed
and
he
could
feel
a
lump
rising
i
i
guess
i
m
all
right
he
said
he
tried
to
stand
up
the
trees
the
sky
the
building
started
to
swing
around
before
his
eyes
he
grabbed
bill
s
hand
for
support
within
a
few
minutes
he
felt
better
bill
took
his
arm
and
helped
him
down
the
path
golly
i
sure
as
shootin
messed
that
up
he
said
to
bill
then
he
told
his
friend
what
happened
so
you
figure
it
was
mr
caldwell
bill
asked
when
ronnie
had
finished
well
i
reckon
i
did
then
or
i
wouldn
t
have
called
his
name
but
gosh
now
i
m
not
so
sure
it
was
plenty
dark
what
a
fool
i
was
yelling
out
to
him
boy
could
i
kick
myself
in
the
pants
for
being
so
stupid
yea
bill
agreed
yea
if
you
weren
t
so
woozy
i
d
do
it
for
you
but
what
do
you
say
we
pay
caldwell
a
hurry
call
i
think
we
can
still
beat
him
back
to
his
cottage
seeing
he
s
got
to
detour
around
through
the
woods
feel
well
enough
to
try
it
ronnie
agreed
that
he
did
except
for
a
slight
throbbing
in
his
head
he
felt
as
well
as
he
had
before
the
accident
they
hurried
down
the
cobblestone
road
using
their
flashlights
only
when
they
needed
them
to
find
the
way
they
approached
caldwell
s
cottage
cautiously
light
was
shining
from
the
two
windows
that
faced
the
path
let
s
take
a
peek
in
the
window
first
bill
whispered
you
know
see
what
he
s
doing
before
he
gets
wise
that
we
re
here
they
crept
noiselessly
to
the
window
and
peered
over
the
sill
caldwell
was
seated
before
a
small
table
that
held
his
typewriter
and
a
kerosene
lamp
he
was
busily
at
work
bill
leaned
over
to
whisper
in
ronnie
s
ear
boy
either
he
s
real
sneaky
or
else
he
wasn
t
ever
out
of
the
building
he
said
he
looks
as
if
he
d
been
at
work
for
hours
maybe
he
has
been
ronnie
said
but
if
caldwell
wasn
t
their
man
why
had
he
turned
so
instinctively
when
ronnie
had
called
out
his
name
let
s
go
in
and
have
a
talk
with
him
just
the
same
bill
suggested
but
don
t
let
him
know
we
suspect
him
of
anything
caldwell
opened
the
door
to
them
after
bill
had
knocked
well
he
exclaimed
motioning
for
them
to
come
in
how
did
you
know
i
was
just
itching
for
a
little
company
the
two
boys
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
his
cot
caldwell
turned
his
chair
away
from
his
typewriter
to
sit
facing
them
what
are
you
doing
down
here
at
this
time
of
the
night
we
were
working
on
our
sign
bill
answered
i
thought
i
saw
a
light
coming
from
your
office
windows
and
i
was
thinking
about
going
down
to
investigate
earlier
but
i
got
so
wrapped
up
in
my
work
i
just
never
got
around
to
it
ronnie
glanced
over
at
bill
to
find
his
friend
looking
at
him
too
bill
was
thinking
the
same
thing
evidently
caldwell
was
claiming
that
he
hadn
t
left
his
cabin
all
evening
that
didn
t
prove
a
thing
of
course
ronnie
realized
in
fact
caldwell
might
have
told
them
this
just
to
cover
his
movements
mr
caldwell
got
up
and
crossed
over
to
his
kitchen
and
returned
with
a
box
of
crackers
i
can
t
offer
you
much
but
perhaps
you
ll
have
a
few
crackers
thanks
bill
answered
taking
several
we
can
t
stay
much
longer
i
ve
got
to
be
getting
back
home
soon
a
miller
moth
made
a
dive
bomb
attack
at
the
lamp
caldwell
picked
up
a
folded
newspaper
he
had
handy
and
swatted
the
insect
the
lamp
swayed
precariously
and
the
moth
flew
off
unharmed
dad
s
got
some
old
screens
in
the
barn
ronnie
said
i
ll
bet
you
they
could
be
made
to
fit
the
windows
might
even
be
a
screen
door
i
ll
ask
him
about
putting
them
up
you
just
get
them
to
me
along
with
some
tools
and
i
ll
do
the
putting
up
gladly
the
man
answered
bill
stuffed
the
last
cracker
into
his
mouth
we
d
better
be
getting
along
right
now
mr
caldwell
came
to
the
door
with
them
if
i
can
help
you
with
your
tourist
business
in
any
way
just
say
the
word
you
re
welcome
to
use
any
of
the
information
i
ve
gathered
when
you
re
talking
about
the
village
thanks
mr
caldwell
ronnie
answered
we
just
might
take
you
up
on
that
i
ve
been
thinking
maybe
we
d
mimeograph
a
little
booklet
about
the
place
he
turned
to
bill
we
could
use
the
grange
mimeograph
and
the
paper
wouldn
t
cost
much
we
could
tell
all
about
the
glassworks
and
life
in
the
village
in
the
olden
days
and
and
the
mysterious
locked
up
office
building
bill
added
picking
up
the
idea
with
great
interest
and
even
about
those
old
glass
candlesticks
of
your
grandfather
s
ronnie
candlesticks
exclaimed
mr
caldwell
rorth
candlesticks
ronnie
nodded
they
must
be
worth
a
great
deal
caldwell
said
what
do
they
look
like
ronnie
described
them
caldwell
nodded
slowly
as
ronnie
brought
out
detail
after
detail
i
d
certainly
like
to
see
them
sometime
he
said
when
ronnie
had
finished
come
on
up
to
the
house
any
time
ronnie
offered
i
m
sure
grandpa
would
be
glad
to
show
them
to
you
when
they
were
alone
outside
bill
turned
to
ronnie
you
know
he
said
i
think
caldwell
is
kind
of
a
swell
guy
i
just
can
t
believe
he
s
the
one
sneaking
around
the
village
and
running
off
when
we
catch
sight
of
him
ronnie
thought
about
this
after
he
had
left
bill
and
was
hurrying
up
the
steep
incline
to
the
orchard
above
was
bill
right
about
mr
caldwell
there
were
arguments
for
and
against
that
silhouette
of
the
man
s
face
against
the
night
sky
for
instance
ronnie
had
tried
again
and
again
during
the
evening
to
convince
himself
that
he
had
been
wrong
when
he
had
called
out
caldwell
s
name
but
somehow
he
just
couldn
t
do
it
and
he
couldn
t
forget
what
had
happened
that
morning
it
had
been
daylight
then
was
it
just
a
coincidence
that
both
times
caldwell
s
name
had
come
to
his
mind
he
d
talk
to
gramps
about
it
that
s
what
he
d
do
but
when
he
arrived
home
he
found
the
door
to
his
grandfather
s
room
closed
and
no
light
showing
from
underneath
he
climbed
the
stairs
and
headed
for
his
room
phil
was
in
his
own
room
in
his
pajamas
and
lying
on
his
bed
with
a
pile
of
old
comic
books
at
his
side
a
wild
idea
hit
ronnie
suddenly
and
he
poked
his
head
into
phil
s
room
have
you
been
in
the
house
all
evening
he
demanded
maybe
just
maybe
phil
was
playing
tricks
on
them
and
he
had
been
in
the
padlocked
house
phil
looked
at
his
brother
in
surprise
what
s
the
matter
the
heat
got
you
or
something
sure
i
was
here
all
the
time
ok
i
was
just
wondering
phil
dropped
his
comic
book
and
sat
up
say
something
real
interesting
must
have
happened
to
you
down
in
the
village
or
you
wouldn
t
be
putting
me
on
the
witness
stand
come
on
out
with
it
nothing
happened
you
re
imagining
things
that
s
all
ronnie
hurried
down
the
hall
hoping
that
phil
wouldn
t
have
the
energy
to
follow
him
phil
didn
t
ronnie
ducked
into
his
room
and
closed
the
door
then
he
went
over
to
the
window
and
looked
out
the
valley
was
in
complete
darkness
even
the
lights
in
mr
caldwell
s
cottage
were
out
the
deserted
village
was
asleep
chapter
after
breakfast
the
following
morning
ronnie
looked
for
gramps
in
his
room
but
there
was
no
sign
of
him
there
nor
anywhere
about
the
house
it
was
mrs
butler
who
told
ronnie
where
his
grandfather
had
gone
why
seems
to
me
i
saw
him
headed
out
the
door
a
while
back
she
said
went
off
toward
the
orchard
i
d
guess
ronnie
took
off
after
his
grandfather
he
found
him
sitting
on
a
rock
at
the
top
of
the
bluff
and
looking
out
over
the
valley
and
the
deserted
village
hi
gramps
ronnie
greeted
him
well
now
boy
come
set
a
spell
with
me
my
old
legs
won
t
let
me
get
down
there
in
the
village
any
more
but
by
golly
they
can
t
keep
me
from
sitting
here
and
looking
gramps
grandfather
shifted
his
position
by
leaning
heavily
on
his
cane
he
faced
ronnie
boy
you
ve
got
something
on
your
mind
and
don
t
tell
me
you
haven
t
because
i
ve
come
to
know
when
you
re
troubled
ronnie
nodded
there
s
something
going
on
down
in
the
village
that
i
m
all
mixed
up
about
you
re
darned
tootin
there
s
something
going
on
down
there
the
old
man
retorted
those
seaway
people
plotting
and
scheming
to
take
the
village
away
from
me
i
know
what
s
going
on
not
that
gramps
something
else
ronnie
went
on
to
tell
him
about
the
blanket
and
the
candle
he
had
seen
through
the
crack
in
the
shutter
and
about
the
strange
light
that
had
startled
bill
and
him
the
night
before
he
told
gramps
about
the
mysterious
prowler
too
gramps
he
concluded
do
you
suppose
it
s
got
anything
to
do
with
the
secret
of
the
boarded
up
building
maybe
there
s
something
hidden
there
that
this
man
is
looking
for
grandfather
looked
at
ronnie
sharply
what
man
he
demanded
ronnie
looked
away
i
don
t
know
who
it
was
he
answered
come
on
boy
speak
up
if
you
know
really
gramps
i
m
not
sure
i
don
t
want
to
say
until
i
m
real
sure
grandfather
didn
t
press
the
point
ronnie
he
said
this
village
has
been
the
love
and
joy
of
my
life
but
lately
it
s
just
as
if
just
as
if
the
prophecy
were
meant
to
come
true
what
prophecy
gramps
ronnie
asked
is
that
what
the
secret
s
all
about
yes
in
a
way
i
suppose
the
old
man
looked
out
over
the
valley
and
then
back
to
the
boy
i
reckon
the
time
has
come
when
you
must
hear
the
story
it
can
t
die
the
way
i
d
hoped
it
would
the
past
won
t
let
it
gramps
took
out
his
pipe
and
tobacco
pouch
from
his
pocket
he
filled
the
bowl
of
the
pipe
and
placed
the
stem
between
his
yellowed
teeth
turn
your
mind
back
boy
to
what
i
was
telling
you
the
other
evening
when
we
were
talking
about
the
candlesticks
he
lit
a
match
and
drew
heavily
on
the
stem
of
the
pipe
until
the
tobacco
glowed
crimson
then
he
exhaled
the
blue
smoke
in
a
cloud
that
rose
over
his
head
i
told
you
about
your
great
great
grandfather
ezra
and
his
partner
jacob
williams
if
you
ll
recollect
this
williams
fellow
was
a
kind
of
no
good
scoundrel
from
everything
i
ve
heard
tell
and
why
ezra
got
bamboozled
into
such
an
arrangement
nobody
ll
ever
know
took
him
in
as
a
full
partner
he
did
lock
stock
and
barrel
or
in
other
words
glassworks
land
and
merchandise
then
half
this
land
doesn
t
really
belong
to
us
gramps
is
that
right
yep
i
reckon
so
if
there
s
anyone
around
to
claim
it
i
ll
come
to
that
later
well
anyway
these
two
partners
seemed
to
have
gotten
along
well
for
a
number
of
years
the
business
flourished
rorth
glassware
got
to
be
known
practically
around
the
world
then
around
or
thereabouts
things
started
worsening
up
and
by
the
company
was
well
nigh
bankrupt
now
this
jacob
williams
who
was
keeping
the
books
finally
got
around
to
telling
your
great
great
grandfather
how
bad
things
were
and
darned
if
he
didn
t
accuse
ezra
of
milking
the
company
dry
yep
he
claimed
ezra
had
been
stealing
quantities
of
money
and
glassware
from
the
company
and
this
williams
didn
t
stop
at
that
he
spread
it
all
around
the
neighborhood
and
pretty
soon
people
began
to
believe
it
was
true
but
it
really
wasn
t
was
it
gramps
ronnie
asked
anxiously
can
t
really
answer
that
because
it
s
never
been
proven
one
way
or
the
other
but
maybe
when
you
hear
the
rest
of
what
happened
you
ll
understand
it
a
mite
better
now
one
day
in
june
of
jacob
williams
disappeared
of
course
everybody
started
saying
ezra
had
done
away
with
him
to
keep
him
from
accusing
ezra
of
the
thefts
and
i
guess
there
was
some
evidence
to
make
people
believe
it
too
first
of
all
more
money
and
glassware
were
missing
then
there
was
this
man
john
sutton
a
worker
at
the
glassworks
who
testified
that
he
d
heard
ezra
and
jacob
williams
arguing
and
shouting
at
one
another
then
when
he
passed
by
the
building
again
later
he
claims
he
heard
jacob
screaming
for
help
he
didn
t
go
in
figuring
it
was
none
of
his
business
but
later
on
he
got
to
thinking
about
it
and
went
back
there
was
no
sign
of
ezra
or
jacob
williams
fact
is
that
was
the
last
anybody
ever
heard
of
jacob
williams
old
ezra
made
a
search
for
his
partner
even
put
notice
of
a
reward
in
the
paper
for
anybody
sending
news
of
him
it
was
like
the
earth
had
swallowed
jacob
him
and
the
money
and
the
missing
glassware
grandfather
tamped
his
pipe
with
a
leathery
thumb
and
continued
well
boy
people
here
put
two
and
two
together
and
there
began
to
be
talk
when
people
begin
to
talk
they
make
things
bigger
and
meaner
old
ezra
had
killed
jacob
to
cover
up
his
own
thefts
and
he
d
hidden
the
body
somewhere
search
parties
went
over
every
square
foot
of
the
village
but
they
didn
t
turn
up
a
clue
well
no
matter
people
said
jacob
williams
curse
was
on
the
rorth
family
until
jacob
s
death
was
avenged
grandfather
puffed
hurriedly
at
his
pipe
to
start
up
the
dying
coals
but
what
happened
to
great
great
grandfather
ezra
ronnie
asked
the
case
came
before
the
grand
jury
but
the
jury
failed
to
indict
ezra
there
wasn
t
proof
of
anything
really
so
ezra
was
freed
but
people
didn
t
stop
accusing
him
for
a
long
time
some
even
tried
to
find
jacob
williams
son
then
a
man
in
his
late
twenties
to
persuade
him
to
come
back
and
avenge
his
father
s
death
but
he
wasn
t
anywhere
to
be
found
then
came
reports
of
people
who
claimed
they
d
seen
jacob
williams
ghost
near
the
old
office
building
and
there
were
those
who
said
the
ghost
had
cried
out
that
he
d
never
stop
haunting
the
rorth
family
until
his
death
was
avenged
funny
thing
was
though
no
rorth
ever
saw
this
ghost
which
just
proves
the
whole
thing
s
a
phony
ronnie
exclaimed
who
believes
in
ghosts
anyway
no
one
excepting
maybe
those
who
haven
t
gotten
a
proper
education
but
there
s
more
to
this
story
a
few
years
after
williams
disappeared
an
epidemic
of
typhoid
struck
the
village
probably
came
from
drinking
the
water
out
of
goose
brook
anyway
lots
of
people
died
and
the
rest
left
like
rats
from
a
sinking
ship
soon
there
were
only
ezra
and
his
family
left
he
sent
them
away
too
while
he
stayed
behind
to
close
up
the
glassworks
never
opened
again
when
ezra
s
wife
and
my
father
returned
they
had
the
office
boarded
up
tight
and
padlocked
and
i
guess
it
was
never
opened
until
i
went
in
there
five
or
six
years
ago
you
were
hunting
for
something
weren
t
you
gramps
yep
something
that
would
prove
ezra
didn
t
harm
his
partner
yep
that
s
right
it
was
a
terrible
blot
on
the
family
name
i
couldn
t
stand
the
thought
of
it
but
all
my
searching
proved
nothing
i
m
afraid
the
evidence
if
there
is
any
will
be
covered
by
the
floodwaters
when
they
come
now
who
s
the
one
giving
up
without
a
fight
grandfather
smiled
down
at
ronnie
you
re
right
boy
that
wasn
t
a
rorth
talking
then
but
a
discouraged
old
man
ronnie
looked
down
into
the
valley
the
thin
mists
that
had
settled
in
the
lowlands
during
the
night
were
dissipating
now
under
the
hot
sun
gramps
do
you
think
this
man
i
saw
is
hunting
for
evidence
too
the
way
you
were
grandfather
thought
over
the
question
for
a
moment
or
two
nope
i
don
t
think
so
ronald
more
n
likely
if
he
s
hunting
for
anything
at
all
he
s
after
the
money
and
glassware
that
was
stolen
there
ve
been
others
before
him
gramps
ronnie
asked
again
what
finally
happened
to
great
great
grandfather
ezra
well
when
my
father
and
mother
returned
after
the
epidemic
was
over
they
found
him
in
the
office
building
he
was
dead
from
the
typhoid
but
everyone
said
it
was
jacob
s
ghost
that
did
it
the
old
man
grasped
the
head
of
his
cane
with
both
hands
and
pulled
himself
to
his
feet
he
stood
for
a
minute
with
the
hot
breeze
ruffling
his
snow
white
beard
and
hair
while
he
looked
down
into
the
valley
his
sharp
eyes
darted
from
one
building
to
another
and
finally
rested
upon
the
old
padlocked
building
the
answer
s
in
there
somewhere
ronnie
heard
him
say
although
the
wind
tried
to
take
his
words
away
i
hope
the
good
lord
will
let
me
live
long
enough
to
see
it
found
he
turned
to
face
the
boy
ronnie
he
said
ronnie
your
father
s
in
town
now
but
when
he
comes
back
tonight
you
tell
him
i
said
he
s
to
let
you
have
the
keys
to
the
rorth
office
building
you
and
this
friend
of
yours
take
a
good
look
around
inside
and
maybe
you
can
find
what
this
man
is
doing
in
there
and
maybe
your
keen
young
eyes
will
find
what
i
ve
failed
to
find
all
the
times
i
looked
sure
gramps
ronnie
s
eyes
lit
up
with
excitement
you
bet
we
ll
find
something
to
prove
great
great
grandfather
ezra
didn
t
harm
mr
williams
and
maybe
we
ll
find
the
glassware
and
the
money
too
grandfather
was
looking
down
into
the
valley
again
went
through
every
paper
in
the
place
he
was
saying
not
waiting
for
ronnie
to
finish
talking
hundreds
of
them
but
not
a
clue
not
a
single
clue
just
old
bills
and
statements
and
records
put
them
all
back
in
the
files
i
did
just
the
way
i
found
them
but
somewhere
in
that
building
there
s
an
answer
i
m
convinced
of
that
he
drew
himself
up
tall
and
breathed
in
deeply
and
squared
his
shoulders
we
aren
t
licked
yet
no
sir
not
by
a
long
shot
now
boy
how
about
helping
an
old
man
back
to
the
house
chapter
now
we
re
officially
in
business
ronnie
exclaimed
he
stowed
the
spade
he
had
been
carrying
in
the
corner
of
their
office
and
dropped
into
a
chair
his
hair
was
wet
with
perspiration
and
beads
of
it
were
rolling
down
his
face
and
stomach
that
s
the
hardest
ground
i
ve
ever
had
to
dig
a
hole
in
he
added
fanning
himself
with
a
newspaper
the
boys
had
just
finished
erecting
the
sign
alongside
the
highway
layers
of
coarse
gravel
and
heavy
blue
clay
had
made
the
job
of
digging
difficult
but
as
bill
had
said
they
wanted
the
sign
planted
plenty
deep
so
the
first
heavy
wind
wouldn
t
carry
it
away
who
knows
he
had
added
we
may
want
it
there
a
long
long
time
on
their
way
back
from
the
highway
ronnie
had
told
bill
everything
that
grandfather
had
said
about
old
ezra
rorth
bill
said
nothing
until
they
reached
the
office
ronnie
he
said
then
ronnie
this
afternoon
you
bring
the
key
to
the
padlocked
building
with
you
you
hear
we
ve
got
business
to
attend
to
in
there
you
bet
we
have
ronnie
agreed
once
we
find
out
who
this
man
is
who
s
sneaking
around
the
village
and
why
too
maybe
we
ll
get
to
the
bottom
of
all
these
shenanigans
bill
nodded
we
ll
search
the
building
from
top
to
bottom
and
maybe
we
ll
have
more
luck
than
your
grandfather
did
maybe
we
ll
clean
up
this
mess
around
your
family
name
i
know
my
great
great
grandfather
didn
t
harm
jacob
williams
or
steal
anything
either
i
just
know
it
sure
ronnie
sure
but
we
ve
got
to
prove
it
and
that
isn
t
going
to
be
easy
not
after
all
these
years
have
passed
but
we
ll
do
it
every
minute
we
ve
got
when
we
aren
t
showing
people
around
we
ll
use
to
hunt
for
clues
and
the
first
thing
we
do
is
search
that
old
office
building
so
don
t
forget
to
bring
the
keys
ronnie
sprawled
a
little
lower
in
his
chair
and
watched
a
drop
of
perspiration
run
down
over
a
fold
of
skin
on
his
stomach
bill
he
knew
wanted
to
hunt
for
clues
immediately
but
it
was
just
too
hot
to
move
it
all
seemed
like
such
a
tremendous
almost
impossible
job
hadn
t
grandfather
tried
and
failed
a
moment
later
phil
sauntered
into
the
building
and
plunked
himself
down
in
the
one
remaining
chair
i
don
t
know
why
i
killed
myself
coming
down
here
he
sighed
i
don
t
see
why
you
did
either
ronnie
commented
with
a
smile
all
you
did
was
move
from
the
hammock
to
that
chair
you
shouldn
t
exert
yourself
so
much
that
s
what
i
keep
telling
myself
said
phil
a
horsefly
buzzed
angrily
across
the
ceiling
and
slammed
into
the
wall
it
fell
dizzily
for
a
few
feet
and
then
regained
its
balance
off
it
went
in
the
opposite
direction
and
slammed
into
the
other
wall
crazy
critter
phil
commented
see
how
he
s
exerting
himself
and
where
does
it
get
him
before
ronnie
could
think
of
an
appropriate
answer
there
were
footsteps
on
the
path
and
mr
caldwell
popped
his
head
in
the
door
he
entered
and
perched
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
desk
i
m
going
up
to
your
house
this
afternoon
to
take
a
look
at
those
candlesticks
he
told
ronnie
from
the
description
you
gave
me
i
d
say
that
the
pair
i
have
at
home
are
identical
the
horsefly
suddenly
stopped
buzzing
and
the
office
seemed
strangely
quiet
ronnie
sat
up
and
looked
at
mr
caldwell
his
mouth
hanging
open
just
a
bit
did
did
you
say
you
you
had
a
pair
of
candlesticks
like
gramps
yes
mr
caldwell
looked
puzzled
is
that
so
strange
ronnie
gulped
and
nodded
yes
sir
it
is
i
don
t
see
why
there
were
probably
quite
a
few
pairs
turned
out
during
the
years
the
glassworks
was
in
operation
ronnie
opened
his
mouth
to
protest
and
closed
it
again
there
was
plenty
of
time
to
tell
mr
caldwell
what
he
knew
he
decided
to
play
it
safe
for
the
time
being
yes
he
answered
yes
i
suppose
there
could
be
quite
a
few
around
if
they
haven
t
been
lost
or
destroyed
a
car
drew
up
in
the
improvised
parking
lot
and
came
to
a
stop
ronnie
looking
out
the
window
saw
a
man
woman
and
two
boys
leave
the
car
and
start
toward
the
office
ronnie
and
bill
went
out
to
meet
them
we
d
like
to
take
the
tour
are
there
guides
yes
sir
ronnie
answered
we
d
be
glad
to
take
you
about
the
man
looked
first
at
ronnie
and
then
at
bill
he
seemed
a
bit
skeptical
well
all
right
he
said
finally
where
do
we
begin
ronnie
and
bill
led
them
down
the
path
to
the
cobblestone
road
this
is
the
original
road
that
ran
through
the
center
of
the
village
he
told
them
some
of
the
cobblestones
have
been
replaced
from
time
to
time
but
mostly
it
s
just
the
way
it
used
to
be
mules
used
to
pull
cartloads
of
sand
along
this
road
to
be
used
in
making
the
glass
they
swung
off
the
cobblestone
road
and
approached
the
two
story
building
beside
goose
brook
bill
slipping
up
beside
ronnie
whispered
hey
you
re
doing
all
right
now
this
was
the
gristmill
where
all
the
wheat
from
the
surrounding
fields
was
ground
into
flour
that
overshot
water
wheel
you
see
there
was
in
running
order
when
my
grandfather
was
a
boy
he
says
our
family
still
used
it
to
grind
the
grain
they
visited
the
main
building
where
the
glass
had
been
made
and
blown
from
here
they
moved
to
the
general
store
the
blacksmith
shop
the
smith
shop
the
carriage
buildings
and
the
workers
cottages
this
brought
them
in
a
circle
back
to
their
office
there
they
found
another
car
pulled
into
the
parking
area
two
men
were
waiting
inside
the
office
before
entering
bill
and
ronnie
collected
their
fees
and
said
good
by
to
the
first
group
we
enjoyed
the
tour
very
much
the
man
told
ronnie
and
bill
it
was
well
worth
the
stop
thank
you
sir
ronnie
beamed
tell
your
friends
about
it
mr
caldwell
was
still
in
the
office
chatting
with
the
two
men
he
introduced
them
to
ronnie
and
bill
this
is
mr
perkins
and
this
is
mr
brown
ronnie
and
bill
shook
hands
with
the
men
they
re
interested
in
learning
more
about
the
business
you
ve
started
caldwell
went
on
to
explain
you
see
they
re
from
the
massena
sunday
paper
and
they
re
thinking
about
writing
a
story
for
next
sunday
s
edition
that
s
right
brown
broke
in
we
feel
that
more
people
will
take
an
interest
in
the
fate
of
this
place
if
they
ve
heard
about
what
you
two
boys
are
doing
besides
it
ll
help
bring
you
business
gee
that
s
swell
of
you
ronnie
exclaimed
bill
and
i
are
awfully
anxious
to
do
everything
we
can
to
save
the
village
mr
perkins
pulled
out
a
notebook
and
seated
himself
at
the
desk
let
s
make
that
our
first
question
he
said
just
how
do
you
expect
to
save
the
old
village
by
taking
tourists
through
it
ronnie
explained
how
they
hoped
to
raise
some
of
the
money
to
build
a
dam
across
the
narrow
gap
in
the
valley
through
which
goose
brook
ran
down
to
the
river
my
dad
says
it
could
be
done
ronnie
continued
course
we
won
t
get
enough
money
ourselves
to
do
it
but
we
re
hoping
maybe
other
people
will
get
worked
up
enough
to
want
to
help
out
people
are
beginning
to
wake
up
already
mr
brown
said
i
happen
to
know
that
your
father
saw
steve
mercer
the
other
day
and
put
a
bug
in
his
ear
about
the
village
steve
wrote
to
the
seaway
authority
trying
to
convince
them
to
use
your
plan
and
save
the
village
he
got
some
kind
of
a
letter
back
but
they
didn
t
commit
themselves
one
way
or
the
other
it
ll
take
time
but
i
m
sure
it
can
be
done
mr
brown
s
remark
gave
ronnie
some
of
the
encouragement
he
needed
sure
he
d
had
his
doubts
right
from
the
beginning
when
he
d
first
thought
of
opening
the
village
to
the
public
they
would
need
public
support
and
perhaps
more
money
too
unless
the
seaway
agreed
to
foot
the
bill
by
the
time
the
two
men
were
ready
to
leave
mr
perkins
had
several
pages
of
notes
some
of
them
on
the
history
of
the
village
itself
i
think
i
ll
get
a
statement
from
the
seaway
authority
too
brown
said
as
he
slid
into
the
driver
s
seat
he
had
an
impish
smile
on
his
face
that
will
really
put
them
on
the
spot
they
know
how
the
people
around
here
feel
about
the
village
and
if
there
s
a
way
to
save
it
they
ll
have
a
hard
time
explaining
why
not
after
the
car
had
driven
off
mr
caldwell
left
to
work
on
the
notes
he
had
gathered
in
the
glassworks
during
the
morning
ronnie
phil
and
bill
walked
back
toward
their
office
ronnie
had
cooled
off
considerably
and
now
he
felt
more
like
working
again
there
wasn
t
time
before
lunch
for
hunting
for
clues
or
cleaning
out
a
building
but
he
had
an
idea
in
mind
for
a
sign
to
hang
outside
the
office
door
it
would
read
tours
from
and
office
he
had
found
a
suitable
piece
of
wood
the
day
before
and
now
he
set
to
work
sandpapering
it
down
smooth
bill
sat
opposite
him
tipping
back
in
his
chair
again
phil
seemed
restless
and
a
few
minutes
later
announced
that
he
was
going
back
to
the
house
you
know
bill
said
thoughtfully
as
he
watched
ronnie
rubbing
vigorously
with
the
sandpaper
you
know
ronnie
there
are
two
things
that
bother
me
two
questions
i
can
t
answer
yes
ronnie
asked
looking
up
for
a
moment
what
are
they
well
the
first
one
is
this
how
is
this
fellow
we
ve
seen
around
here
getting
in
and
out
of
the
padlocked
building
that
s
a
question
maybe
we
can
answer
this
afternoon
when
i
get
the
key
and
we
get
a
chance
to
look
inside
ronnie
said
maybe
but
i
don
t
see
what
we
can
see
from
the
inside
that
we
can
t
see
from
the
outside
ronnie
ran
his
hand
over
the
wood
to
see
how
smooth
it
was
oh
i
don
t
know
about
that
supposing
he
s
dug
a
tunnel
we
couldn
t
see
that
from
the
outside
anyway
what
s
the
other
question
this
question
s
a
real
stickler
bill
said
remember
what
mr
caldwell
said
before
that
he
has
a
pair
of
candlesticks
like
your
grandfather
s
you
mean
he
thinks
he
has
he
hasn
t
seen
ours
yet
well
let
s
just
say
that
he
finds
out
this
afternoon
that
he
has
and
let
s
say
these
candlesticks
have
come
down
through
his
family
the
way
he
claims
get
to
the
point
will
you
ronnie
was
impatient
all
right
my
question
s
this
doesn
t
that
mean
that
mr
caldwell
owns
half
this
land
chapter
while
ronnie
climbed
the
bluff
and
made
his
way
through
the
orchard
on
his
way
home
to
lunch
he
did
a
great
deal
of
thinking
about
the
question
that
bill
had
raised
he
knew
why
his
friend
had
asked
it
if
the
candlesticks
had
come
down
through
the
caldwell
family
probably
on
his
mother
s
side
then
it
would
be
pretty
safe
to
assume
that
they
were
the
pair
jacob
williams
had
made
for
his
bride
and
if
they
were
then
mr
caldwell
and
his
brother
were
direct
descendants
of
williams
and
would
have
a
claim
against
the
property
but
did
mr
caldwell
know
about
this
if
he
didn
t
know
now
would
he
put
two
and
two
together
and
come
up
with
an
answer
that
depended
upon
how
much
he
knew
about
the
history
of
the
candlesticks
ronnie
decided
and
from
the
way
caldwell
had
talked
earlier
that
afternoon
the
boy
doubted
very
much
that
he
was
aware
of
how
the
candlesticks
had
come
into
his
family
then
probably
he
wouldn
t
know
anything
about
the
hidden
glassware
or
the
money
either
which
would
cross
him
off
the
list
of
suspects
for
the
mysterious
prowler
unless
of
course
the
prowler
wasn
t
hunting
for
the
money
and
glassware
by
the
time
ronnie
reached
the
house
he
had
decided
one
thing
only
it
was
all
very
very
confusing
mrs
butler
served
ronnie
phil
and
the
two
men
their
lunch
at
the
kitchen
table
now
that
the
hay
was
in
the
barn
ronnie
and
phil
had
spent
the
previous
day
helping
their
father
load
the
truck
in
the
field
and
hoist
the
hay
to
the
loft
mr
rorth
had
turned
his
attention
to
the
orchard
the
young
fruit
was
ready
for
spraying
the
weather
s
going
to
hold
for
a
few
more
days
i
think
ronnie
s
father
told
the
others
so
i
think
i
ll
mix
a
batch
of
spray

afternoon
phil
you
want
to
help
me
oh

cough
and
sneeze

the
hammock
worn
through
by
the
end
of
the
summer
at
the
rate
you
re
using
it
the
telephone
rang
ronnie
volunteered
to
answer
it
he
went
into
the
hall
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
lifted
the
receiver
it
was
bill
calling
to
tell
ronnie
that
he
had
to
work
that
afternoon
pa
s
mending
some
fences
and
i
got
to
help
bill
said
but
ronnie
somebody
should
be
at
the
office
in
case
we
get
any
tourists
ronnie
agreed
that
this
was
so
i
ll
hang
around
he
answered
after
lunch
ronnie
went
to
the
cold
cellar
and
selected
two
apples
which
he
stuffed
into
his
pockets
then
he
went
out
to
the
barn
to
see
how
his
father
was
getting
on
with
the
job
of
mixing
spray
i
ll
help

he
said
if
you
really
need
help
only
i
promised
bill

down
at
the
village

one

ronnie
watched
his
father
measure
out
the
poison
powder
dad
gramps
said
i
could
have
the
key
to
the
locked
up
building
mr
rorth
stopped
long
enough
in
his
work
to
look
up
at
the
boy
oh
really
pa
i
told
him
about
how

saw
him

house

seated
at
the
desk
putting
together
a
model
airplane
what
re
you
after
he
demanded
as
ronnie
pulled
open
the
desk

was
evasive
he
found
the
key
and
pocketed
it

nothing
in
that
building
that
isn
t
in
all
the
rest
just
a
lot
of
dust
and
dirt
and
a
few
rats
nests
ten
minutes
later
ronnie
had
the
door
of
their
office
open
and
was
sitting
on
the
doorsill
waiting
for
customers
he
had
the
key
to
the
locked
up
building
in
his
pocket
but
somehow
it
didn
t
seem
quite
fair
to
bill
to
go
inside
without
him
after
a
while
ronnie
got
tired
just
sitting
and
doing
nothing
so
he
went
inside
and
finished
up
the
sign
he
had
been
working
on
then
he
found
a
rock
and
an
old
nail
and
using
these
tacked
the
sign
into
place
over
the
top
of
the
door
he
sat
down
on
the
doorsill
again
and
waited
a
porcupine
was
rattling
and
thrashing
on
the
thin
top
branches
of
a
maple
tree
ronnie
watched
it
for
a
while
the
animal
didn
t
seem
to
have
a
care
in
the
world
the
afternoon
wore
on
but
no
tourists
appeared
ronnie
got
up
and
started
slowly
down
the
path
it
wouldn
t
hurt
to
take
one
quick
trip
around
the
locked
up
building
and
maybe
steal
a
peek
through
the
crack
in
the
shutter
then
he
could
climb
up
on
the
roof
and
sit
there
for
a
time
he
could
see
so
much
more
from
up
there
and
if
a
car
came
up
the
dirt
road
he
d
know
about
it
in
time
to
get
back
to
the
office
he
circled
around
the
old
office
building
as
he
d
planned
and
then
he
climbed
up
on
the
log
and
peered
through
the
window
everything
looked
just
about
the
same
as
the
last
time
except
for
some
white
objects
scattered
about
the
floor
he
couldn
t
make
out
what
they
were
because
of
the
darkness
but
he
decided
they
might
be
pieces
of
paper
well
he
d
take
one
more
quick
look
at
the
outside
of
the
building
and
then
he
d
get
up
on
the
roof
and
see
if
he
could
spot
any
river
boats
on
the
st
lawrence
but
when
he
got
around
to
the
rear
of
the
building
something
on
the
ground
caught
his
eye
nothing
very
startling
but
the
thin
layer
of
sawdust
sprinkled
on
top
of
some
of
the
leaves
set
him
wondering
carpenter
ants
maybe
or
had
someone
been
sawing
firewood
mr
caldwell
perhaps
the
boy
concluded
but
when
he
looked
about
for
some
sign
of
the
white
butt
ends
of
the
discarded
pieces
of
logs
that
would
surely
be
left
lying
around
he
found
none
his
brow
puckered
in
a
frown
he
gathered
a
pinch
of
the
sawdust
and
brought
it
up
closer
to
his
face
so
he
could
examine
it
rolling
it
around
between
his
fingers
to
get
the
feel
of
it
he
couldn
t
be
sure
but
it
felt
fresh
maybe
this
sawdust
could
help
him
find
out
how
the
stranger
was
getting
into
the
building
he
turned
to
inspect
the
rear
wall
of
the
building
at
first
glance
it
looked
just
like
all
the
other
walls
but
when
he
looked
closer
he
found
a
faint
irregular
crack
following
the
contour
of
the
shingles
tracing
it
he
discovered
that
it
formed
a
rough
square
i
ll
bet
that
whole
section
comes
out
he
whispered
apparently
the
shingles
had
been
removed
first
then
a
hole
cut
through
the
boards
between
the
studs
and
the
shingles
nailed
cleverly
back
in
place
ronnie
remembered
the
tools
that
bill
s
father
had
found
missing
from
his
barn
someone
the
boy
thought
had
gone
to
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
make
sure
that
no
one
found
his
entranceway
he
d
have
to
try
the
trap
door
out
of
course
to
see
how
it
worked
he
gripped
the
shingles
from
underneath
and
pushed
up
gently
the
section
moved
and
then
the
bottom
came
free
and
a
minute
later
the
entire
piece
had
come
away
from
the
wall
ronnie
poked
his
head
inside
and
looked
around
the
air
smelled
stale
and
moldy
he
heard
the
flutter
of
wings
beating
against
the
inside
of
the
chimney
and
knew
that
one
of
the
swifts
was
entering
the
nest
in
the
semidarkness
he
could
make
out
some
of
the
larger
objects
in
the
room
the
fireplace
an
old
fashioned
roll
top
desk
a
filing
cabinet
and
several
chairs
he
withdrew
his
head
and
slipped
his
feet
through
instead
then
twisting
about
with
his
back
toward
the
inside
he
pulled
the
upper
part
of
his
body
through
for
a
minute
he
stood
near
the
opening
not
knowing
quite
what
to
do
next
he
had
a
strange
uneasy
feeling
that
somebody
was
watching
him
perhaps
it
would
be
better
if
he
put
the
trap
door
back
into
place
then
if
the
man
who
made
it
should
come
by
outside
he
wouldn
t
notice
anything
different
and
he
d
go
away
but
after
he
had
the
trap
door
back
in
its
place
he
was
a
little
sorry
that
he
d
done
it
it
was
pitch
black
in
the
room
now
he
felt
in
his
pocket
and
found
a
package
of
book
matches
he
tore
one
loose
and
struck
it
the
flame
seemed
very
feeble
but
it
gave
him
a
few
moments
to
look
around
the
room
he
noticed
the
papers
scattered
about
the
floor
and
saw
that
the
filing
cabinet
near
him
had
been
emptied
and
the
drawers
left
leaning
against
the
wall
it
was
clear
to
the
boy
that
someone
had
been
searching
through
the
papers
of
the
old
rorth
glassworks
when
the
match
had
burned
out
he
wet
his
finger
and
cooled
the
hot
end
and
dropped
the
match
to
the
floor
he
lit
another
and
moved
toward
the
fireplace
his
foot
brushed
against
something
looking
down
he
discovered
the
stub
of
a
candle
and
he
stooped
to
pick
it
up
the
light
from
the
candle
gave
him
a
better
view
of
the
room
now
he
could
see
an
old
leather
upholstered
chair
a
brass
spittoon
and
a
metal
coat
rack
raising
the
candle
he
saw
above
the
mantelpiece
a
white
bearded
man
with
a
bald
head
rimmed
with
tufts
of
fluffy
hair
the
man
looked
down
at
him
with
sharp
piercing
brown
eyes
from
a
massive
oak
picture
frame
ronnie
backed
up
a
few
steps
and
the
eyes
seemed
to
follow
him
as
he
moved
great
great
grandfather
he
asked
but
when
he
heard
the
sound
of
his
voice
he
grinned
at
his
foolishness
he
lowered
the
candle
hastily
and
thrust
it
inside
the
huge
opening
of
the
fireplace
a
partially
decomposed
mouse
lay
just
beneath
the
pair
of
beautifully
molded
andirons
ronnie
poked
his
head
inside
the
fireplace
and
looked
up
the
light
from
the
candle
reached
almost
as
high
as
the
swifts
nest
sure
ronnie
told
himself
a
powerful
flashlight
shining
up
the
chimney
flues
could
have
made
the
weird
light
they
had
seen
several
evenings
before
he
heard
the
young
swifts
chirping
in
the
nest
overhead
and
saw
a
single
yellow
beak
protruding
over
the
edge
for
a
second
or
two
i
m
not
going
to
hurt
you
none
he
said
and
then
realized
that
the
sound
of
his
voice
would
frighten
the
young
birds
even
more
than
the
light
ronnie
backed
out
of
the
fireplace
and
stood
for
a
moment
or
two
near
the
center
of
the
room
undecided
on
what
he
would
do
next
he
wished
that
he
hadn
t
come
through
the
trap
door
but
had
come
around
and
opened
the
regular
door
with
his
key
then
he
d
have
more
light
and
could
inspect
the
building
and
its
furnishings
more
carefully
well
he
d
have
time
to
do
that
when
bill
and
he
returned
he
started
toward
the
rear
wall
ready
to
leave
but
he
had
taken
no
more
than
a
few
steps
when
he
froze
in
his
tracks
his
heart
racing
wildly
from
outside
behind
the
building
he
could
hear
the
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
in
the
dry
leaves
the
same
quick
footsteps
he
had
heard
inside
the
building
chapter
bill
beckney
s
cat
had
cornered
a
mouse
in
the
concrete
manure
pit
one
afternoon
the
year
before
the
mouse
ran
from
one
side
of
the
pit
to
the
other
trying
to
avoid
the
cat
s
claws
ronnie
remembered
the
picture
all
too
vividly
now
as
he
stood
with
his
feet
frozen
to
the
floor
and
his
heart
beating
like
a
tom
tom
and
the
sound
of
the
footsteps
coming
closer
and
closer
with
each
second
only
now
he
was
the
mouse
he
knew
there
wasn
t
a
chance
that
he
could
escape
the
door
was
padlocked
on
the
other
side
and
even
the
key
in
his
pocket
couldn
t
help
him
the
opening
in
the
wall
through
which
he
had
come
would
place
him
face
to
face
with
his
opponent
he
had
to
hide
but
where
anywhere
just
as
long
as
he
did
it
quickly
his
legs
and
feet
came
to
life
again
he
swung
about
holding
up
the
candle
as
he
searched
for
a
place
large
enough
to
hide
the
flickering
light
picked
out
the
fireplace
he
started
for
it
quickly
behind
him
small
creaks
and
thumps
told
him
that
the
section
of
wall
was
being
removed
doubling
over
he
swung
his
body
into
the
fireplace
the
acrid
smell
of
stale
wet
ashes
struck
his
nose
he
straightened
up
and
blew
out
the
candle
suddenly
light
flooded
the
fireplace
the
section
of
wall
had
been
completely
removed
looking
down
he
saw
his
feet
and
legs
illuminated
as
by
a
floodlight
he
knew
he
couldn
t
stay
where
he
was
if
he
wanted
to
remain
hidden
desperately
reaching
up
his
hands
he
found
a
narrow
ledge
and
using
this
as
a
support
he
pulled
his
feet
up
until
he
was
sure
they
were
out
of
sight
then
he
moved
them
cautiously
until
he
found
a
small
ledge
where
he
could
gain
a
toehold
now
he
could
ease
the
strain
on
his
hands
and
arms
whoever
was
in
the
room
had
evidently
returned
to
continue
his
search
a
door
came
open
with
a
jerk
and
more
papers
fluttered
to
the
floor
within
the
boy
s
range
of
vision
please
please
don
t
do
any
more
hunting
in
the
fireplace
ronnie
prayed
the
minutes
dragged
on
the
muscles
in
the
boy
s
arms
and
legs
and
back
began
to
ache
twice
he
thought
of
moving
but
each
time
he
decided
against
it
too
risky
he
couldn
t
take
the
chance
of
slipping
or
making
a
noise
now
the
intruder
was
tapping
with
some
heavy
object
first
against
the
floor
boards
in
different
parts
of
the
room
and
then
upon
the
bricks
of
the
fireplace
now
ronnie
thought
now
would
be
a
good
chance
to
ease
his
muscles
if
he
moved
very
carefully
the
small
sounds
he
might
make
would
be
drowned
out
by
the
tapping
shifting
some
of
his
weight
to
his
right
leg
he
began
to
slide
his
palm
along
the
top
of
the
ledge
toward
the
rear
of
the
fireplace
he
had
moved
no
more
than
a
few
inches
when
the
side
of
his
hand
touched
an
object
resting
on
the
ledge
he
knew
it
wasn
t
part
of
the
brickwork
because
it
moved
along
with
his
hand
it
might
be
well
perhaps
a
book
of
some
kind
he
decided
a
book
maybe
just
maybe
this
was
the
very
thing
that
the
intruder
was
looking
for
and
just
maybe
it
was
the
clue
that
grandfather
had
hunted
for
and
never
found
a
tingle
of
excitement
and
anticipation
ran
down
ronnie
s
back
he
just
had
to
get
hold
of
the
object
and
find
out
for
sure
what
it
was
and
he
could
do
it
too
with
risk
of
course
that
he
d
lose
his
balance
and
fall
from
his
perch
it
was
going
to
take
a
lot
of
good
balancing
and
some
muscle
testing
too
but
ronnie
loved
a
challenge
such
as
this
summoning
all
his
strength
he
rested
his
entire
weight
on
one
small
part
of
his
inner
wrist
at
the
same
time
he
curled
his
fingers
up
over
the
object
until
they
reached
the
flat
surface
at
the
top
then
with
a
quick
sudden
movement
he
shifted
his
entire
hand
to
where
his
fingers
had
been
now
his
fingers
could
explore
in
all
directions
without
fear
of
losing
his
balance
and
falling
from
his
perch
it
took
him
only
a
few
moments
to
prove
to
himself
that
his
first
guess
had
been
correct
he
had
discovered
a
small
thick
book
outside
the
fireplace
the
sounds
suddenly
increased
apparently
the
intruder
was
losing
patience
and
had
thrown
caution
away
over
went
the
desk
on
its
side
with
a
loud
crash
out
came
the
drawers
one
after
another
then
the
desk
went
over
again
papers
flew
over
the
floor
in
every
direction
confound
it
the
man
growled
there
s
got
to
be
something
here
somewhere
i
ll
find
it
if
i
have
to
tear
down
the
whole
confounded
building
ronnie
grinned
to
himself
in
the
darkness
of
his
hiding
place
and
his
fingers
tightened
on
the
book
if
the
man
only
knew
how
close
he
had
come
to
finding
what
he
wanted
those
nights
he
had
searched
the
fireplace
with
his
light
but
then
ronnie
s
grin
faded
the
man
s
words
were
still
ringing
in
his
ears
and
there
was
something
familiar
about
the
sound
of
the
voice
something
that
made
ronnie
think
of
caldwell
and
yet
there
was
something
to
the
voice
that
wasn
t
caldwell
s
the
light
at
the
bottom
of
the
fireplace
brightened
and
ronnie
heard
the
footsteps
approaching
the
fireplace
he
drew
in
his
breath
and
held
it
he
flattened
his
body
as
close
against
the
wall
as
he
dared
without
risking
his
balance
the
footsteps
stopped
near
the
hearth
the
man
coughed
the
soles
of
his
shoes
scraped
against
the
hearthstone
as
he
shifted
his
position
then
ronnie
heard
the
scratch
of
a
match
and
smelled
cigarette
smoke
ronnie
frowned
puzzled
he
d
never
seen
caldwell
smoke
of
course
that
wouldn
t
disprove
positively
that
this
man
was
caldwell
but
it
confused
ronnie
more
than
ever
at
last
the
man
turned
and
crossed
the
room
and
the
boy
breathed
more
freely
again
the
footsteps
moved
toward
the
rear
wall
there
they
stopped
for
a
moment
then
ronnie
heard
the
section
of
wall
being
removed
and
a
flood
of
light
from
outside
filled
the
room
ronnie
sighed
long
and
deep
at
last
the
man
was
leaving
as
soon
as
the
wall
section
was
back
in
place
ronnie
took
a
firm
grip
on
the
book
and
dropped
to
the
floor
a
moment
later
he
was
out
of
the
fireplace
and
standing
in
the
blackness
of
the
room
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
what
to
do
next
one
thing
he
did
want
to
do
and
that
was
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
intruder
before
he
disappeared
into
the
woods
he
hurried
across
the
room
tripping
over
one
of
the
desk
drawers
but
managing
to
catch
his
balance
just
in
time
to
save
himself
from
a
headlong
fall
he
reached
the
wall
pushed
open
the
section
of
wall
a
few
inches
from
the
top
and
peered
out
the
brilliant
light
blinded
him
for
a
few
seconds
then
he
saw
the
man
disappearing
into
the
trees
a
short
distance
from
the
building
but
all
ronnie
could
see
was
the
back
of
his
head
and
shoulders
the
rest
of
his
body
was
hidden
in
the
underbrush
it
was
caldwell
and
then
again
it
wasn
t
caldwell
ronnie
just
couldn
t
be
positive
i
reckon
i
m
never
going
to
get
a
real
close
up
look
at
this
fellow
he
told
himself
he
pulled
the
section
of
wall
closed
again
better
to
wait
a
few
minutes
until
he
was
sure
the
man
would
not
see
him
climbing
from
the
building
ronnie
oh
hey
ronnie
he
heard
bill
s
voice
it
seemed
to
be
coming
from
the
direction
of
their
office
the
suddenness
of
his
friend
s
voice
made
ronnie
jump
he
had
seemed
so
far
away
from
his
normal
everyday
life
during
the
past
twenty
minutes
he
found
bill
wandering
slowly
up
the
cobbled
road
while
he
called
ronnie
s
name
every
few
minutes
where
in
tarnation
have
you
been
he
demanded
when
ronnie
reached
him
i
got
through
working
so
i
thought
i
d
come
join
you
come
on
down
to
our
office
and
i
ll
tell
you
all
about
it
ronnie
exclaimed
and
boy
will
your
eyes
pop
when
you
hear
about
it
bill
s
eyes
didn
t
pop
when
he
had
heard
ronnie
s
story
but
he
certainly
was
as
excited
about
the
find
as
his
friend
golly
maybe
we
ve
got
something
real
important
at
last
let
s
see
it
ronnie
they
sat
down
together
at
the
desk
and
ronnie
placed
the
old
book
before
them
it
was
old
very
old
its
leather
bound
cover
was
warped
from
water
and
age
heavy
rains
down
through
the
years
had
found
their
way
to
the
book
s
resting
place
and
drop
by
drop
had
soaked
through
its
pages
carefully
ronnie
opened
the
book
the
long
columns
of
figures
page
after
page
of
them
were
still
legible
despite
the
water
damage
doesn
t
look
very
exciting
bill
said
there
s
nothing
but
numbers
and
entries
like
a
bank
book
but
then
why
would
it
be
hidden
in
the
chimney
ronnie
asked
as
he
continued
to
turn
the
pages
that
old
office
is
full
of
papers
just
like
this
his
voice
showed
his
disappointment
he
had
almost
reached
the
last
page
when
he
exclaimed
look
writing
it
looks
like
a
diary
oh
boy
bill
exclaimed
in
excitement
now
maybe
we
re
getting
somewhere
he
pulled
the
volume
closer
so
he
could
see
it
better
ronnie
began
to
read
aloud
while
bill
followed
the
words
with
his
eyes
july
i
am
desperately
ill
with
the
typhoid
and
sick
at
heart
because
now
when
the
evidence
that
would
clear
my
name
is
at
hand
i
have
not
the
strength
to
bring
it
from
where
it
is
hidden
all
in
this
place
have
gone
away
including
my
dear
wife
and
son
there
is
none
here
to
whom
i
can
reveal
my
discovery
my
strength
is
waning
too
fast
for
me
to
hope
to
reach
town
with
what
i
now
know
therefore
i
shall
take
these
last
moments
to
set
down
the
facts
that
will
clear
my
name
and
the
name
of
those
who
will
come
after
me
but
what
if
jacob
s
son
should
find
this
account
and
destroy
it
for
the
sake
of
his
own
good
name
i
must
hide
the
ledger
in
the
chimney
hoping
that
someone
of
my
family
will
think
to
look
on
the
secret
shelf
where
i
have
hidden
things
before
here
let
it
be
known
that
it
was
jacob
s
own
greed
and
deceit
that
caused
his
death
and
not
my
hand
as
so
many
have
claimed
for
years
he
stole
from
our
company
and
the
proof
lies
with
him
below
to
cover
up
his
thefts
of
money
and
to
direct
the
guilt
to
me
he
from
time
to
time
hid
parts
of
various
glass
shipments
making
it
appear
that
they
had
been
stolen
from
outside
he
also
entered
large
debit
values
in
the
books
to
cover
his
withdrawals
of
money
as
i
write
this
his
body
lies
below
together
with
the
evidence
of
his
guilt
how
he
was
trapped
there
will
probably
never
be
known
rising
waters
may
have
caught
him
unawares
he
did
much
planning
for
his
crimes
but
in
the
end
he
was
trapped
by
his
own
foolishness
and
sent
to
a
slow
death
my
strength
fails
i
must
hide
the
ledger
ronnie
turned
the
page
the
next
one
was
blank
i
guess
that
s
all
he
said
quietly
it
seemed
to
the
boy
as
if
his
great
great
grandfather
had
been
in
the
room
talking
to
him
during
those
last
few
moments
of
his
life
he
thought
of
the
eyes
watching
him
from
the
picture
over
the
fireplace
in
the
padlocked
building
earlier
that
afternoon
yes
in
spirit
anyway
ezra
had
come
back
again
to
make
one
last
desperate
effort
to
save
the
rorth
name
almost
as
if
he
knew
there
wasn
t
much
time
left
to
get
it
done
ronnie
thought
he
felt
the
pressure
of
bill
s
hand
about
his
arm
and
the
movement
brought
his
thoughts
racing
back
to
the
present
he
looked
up
at
bill
his
friend
s
face
was
turned
toward
the
window
ronnie
bill
whispered
to
him
somebody
was
watching
us
through
that
window
chapter
ronnie
went
directly
to
his
room
when
he
reached
the
house
bill
and
he
had
decided
that
this
would
be
the
best
place
to
keep
the
old
ledger
after
what
had
happened
at
their
office
and
since
bill
couldn
t
be
sure
whom
he
had
seen
at
the
window
they
had
to
protect
their
new
possession
against
an
unknown
adversary
anybody
really
could
be
under
suspicion
i
saw
him
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eyes
bill
had
told
ronnie
afterward
when
i
swung
my
head
around
he
was
gone
all
i
know
for
sure
is
that
he
was
wearing
something
red
that
s
what
first
caught
my
attention
i
don
t
remember
caldwell
wearing
red
ronnie
had
said
they
had
searched
the
area
outside
their
office
as
soon
as
the
initial
surprise
had
worn
off
but
had
failed
to
catch
even
a
glimpse
of
the
man
and
then
the
search
had
been
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
two
cars
and
by
the
time
they
d
taken
the
two
groups
around
it
was
too
late
to
continue
hunting
now
ronnie
stretched
out
on
his
bed
with
the
old
volume
propped
up
against
his
pillow
he
wanted
to
reread
his
great
great
grandfather
s
notations
and
do
some
thinking
about
them
a
little
while
later
he
got
up
to
find
a
pencil
and
a
piece
of
paper
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
with
a
magazine
beneath
the
paper
at
the
top
of
the
paper
he
wrote
the
important
things
i
ve
found
out
from
reading
great
great
grandfather
s
diary
then
underneath
he
began
to
jot
down
each
important
fact
great
great
grandfather
didn
t
murder
mr
jacob
williams
the
way
people
think
this
mr
williams
was
the
one
who
was
stealing
the
glassware
and
money
not
great
great
grandfather
williams
tried
to
pin
it
on
great
great
grandfather
great
great
grandfather
just
before
he
wrote
in
this
ledger
had
found
the
glassware
and
money
and
jacob
williams
body
too
somewhere
down
below
i
guess
williams
son
knew
about
the
stealing
and
great
great
grandfather
was
afraid
he
d
destroy
the
ledger
if
he
found
it
so
he
could
protect
his
father
s
name
just
before
he
died
great
great
grandfather
hid
the
ledger
in
the
fireplace
because
he
couldn
t
get
to
the
house
when
ronnie
had
finished
he
stretched
out
on
his
back
with
his
knees
up
in
the
air
and
the
paper
resting
against
them
he
read
over
what
he
had
written
most
of
the
ideas
were
interesting
because
they
proved
great
great
grandfather
s
innocence
but
only
number
three
seemed
to
be
any
help
at
all
in
finding
the
hidden
glassware
and
money
and
this
one
was
so
vague
ronnie
couldn
t
see
that
it
would
be
much
help
either
down
there
could
be
anywhere
on
the
face
of
the
earth
well
maybe
not
that
large
an
area
but
anyway
it
could
mean
the
whole
deserted
village
and
ronnie
couldn
t
see
bill
and
himself
digging
up
the
whole
village
to
find
the
lost
glassware
and
money
ronnie
rested
his
head
back
against
the
bed
and
stared
at
the
ceiling
thinking
surely
great
great
grandfather
must
have
wanted
his
heirs
to
find
the
lost
articles
and
if
he
did
he
certainly
would
have
given
adequate
directions
for
finding
them
why
down
there
must
mean
underneath
the
old
office
building
ronnie
thought
because
that
s
where
great
great
grandfather
was
when
he
wrote
this
it
was
a
startling
discovery
and
its
possibilities
set
the
boy
s
heart
racing
wouldn
t
grandfather
be
surprised
when
ronnie
placed
the
diary
before
him
and
announced
there
gramps
there
s
the
proof
you
wanted
about
great
great
grandfather
ezra
wouldn
t
gramps
smile
then
but
maybe
it
would
be
better
to
wait
until
he
had
the
glassware
and
the
money
then
gramps
eyes
would
really
open
wide
yes
that
s
what
he
d
do
throw
the
whole
thing
at
gramps
all
at
one
time
ronnie
wanted
to
run
from
the
house
and
down
through
the
orchard
to
the
village
and
then
tear
every
board
loose
from
the
floor
of
the
old
padlocked
building
until
he
knew
for
sure
that
he
had
figured
correctly
he
got
up
from
the
bed
and
went
to
the
window
the
sun
was
sinking
fast
in
another
hour
or
two
it
would
be
dark
too
late
in
the
day
to
start
his
search
besides
he
wanted
bill
with
him
when
he
found
the
glassware
and
money
he
decided
to
make
a
trip
to
the
kitchen
to
see
how
mrs
butler
was
getting
on
with
supper
lands
sake
she
exclaimed
when
he
asked
her
how
long
it
would
be
before
he
could
eat
land
sakes
you
re
getting
as
bad
as
your
brother
always
thinking
of
filling
your
stomach
well
it
s
the
right
time
of
the
day
to
be
thinking
of
that
he
told
her
say
where
s
phil
anyway
i
suppose
he
s
in
the
living
room
with
your
grandfather
and
that
mr
caldwell
who
came
to
see
the
candlesticks
a
while
ago
he
is
now
wasn
t
that
a
fine
kettle
of
fish
he
thought
here
he
was
missing
out
on
a
very
important
event
while
he
dawdled
around
in
the
kitchen
talking
with
mrs
butler
he
hurried
down
the
hall
the
door
to
the
living
room
was
partially
closed
ronnie
poked
his
head
through
the
opening
the
two
rorth
candlesticks
were
standing
on
the
desk
mr
caldwell
was
seated
near
them
and
grandfather
directly
across
from
him
phil
was
lolling
on
the
couch
his
bare
feet
resting
on
the
wall
and
his
head
propped
up
with
a
pillow
he
seemed
more
interested
in
the
comic
magazine
on
his
chest
than
what
was
going
on
in
the
room
grandfather
caught
sight
of
ronnie
come
in
boy
come
in
ronnie
pushed
the
door
open
the
rest
of
the
way
and
came
over
to
sit
on
the
floor
near
grandfather
s
chair
i
have
just
finished
explaining
to
mr
caldwell
that
if
he
really
has
a
pair
of
candlesticks
like
these
grandfather
said
to
ronnie
and
if
they
have
come
down
to
him
through
the
family
then
i
guess
we
can
be
pretty
sure
he
s
related
in
some
way
to
the
jacob
williams
who
was
a
partner
of
your
great
great
grandfather
ronnie
gulped
grandfather
had
told
mr
caldwell
all
this
but
why
why
his
amazement
must
have
shown
in
his
face
for
grandfather
gave
him
a
searching
look
and
explained
gently
it
s
got
to
be
that
way
ronald
there
would
be
no
advantage
in
keeping
the
information
from
him
you
see
the
seaway
has
learned
of
the
unsettled
title
to
the
deserted
village
land
at
first
i
thought
this
would
help
me
i
thought
they
would
be
snarled
up
in
such
legal
troubles
that
it
would
be
better
for
them
to
build
the
dam
the
way
we
want
than
to
be
held
up
for
a
year
maybe
more
fighting
us
in
the
courts
but
it
doesn
t
work
that
way
i
learned
the
seaway
just
puts
half
the
value
of
the
property
away
in
a
bank
in
trust
and
if
and
when
the
person
who
s
got
a
claim
on
the
land
shows
up
why
the
money
s
there
and
waiting
i
see
ronnie
said
only
he
didn
t
not
really
this
way
the
whole
affair
s
settled
once
and
for
all
he
looked
closely
at
ronnie
to
see
how
the
boy
was
taking
what
he
had
said
confound
it
ronnie
he
went
on
his
face
flushing
slightly
confound
it
you
don
t
think
i
like
what
s
going
on
do
you
i
m
still
fighting
boy
fighting
for
the
village
and
saving
the
village
from
being
destroyed
that
s
the
important
thing
maybe
with
mr
caldwell
as
a
half
owner
we
ll
add
strength
to
our
side
of
the
fighting
seems
to
me
this
man
s
kind
of
keen
on
saving
the
village
too
ronnie
looked
over
at
caldwell
are
you
mr
caldwell
he
asked
he
wasn
t
seeing
caldwell
not
really
he
was
seeing
the
man
who
had
slipped
into
the
padlocked
building
that
afternoon
the
man
who
had
overturned
furniture
and
thrown
the
family
papers
about
on
the
floor
very
much
so
ronald
mr
caldwell
answered
he
spoke
with
genuine
feeling
perhaps
it
wasn
t
fair
to
accuse
him
ronnie
told
himself
he
had
never
made
a
positive
identification
and
yet
yet
there
were
so
many
times
that
ronnie
had
almost
been
sure
this
comes
as
such
a
complete
surprise
mr
caldwell
was
speaking
again
i
shall
certainly
have
to
look
into
the
matter
i
suppose
there
are
agencies
that
will
trace
a
family
tree
grandfather
nodded
i
d
get
myself
a
good
lawyer
if
i
were
you
he
ll
tell
you
if
you
ve
got
claim
to
the
property
my
brother
was
the
one
who
was
interested
in
our
family
tree
and
the
family
history
of
the
candlesticks
as
a
boy
he
was
always
snooping
through
old
trunks
and
boxes
in
the
attic
caldwell
went
over
and
stood
before
the
candlesticks
touching
the
glass
crystals
lightly
and
lovingly
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
beautiful
beautiful
workmanship
he
said
why
don
t
you
ask
your
brother
phil
rolled
over
to
a
sitting
position
maybe
he
s
been
holding
out
on
you
maybe
he
knows
all
about
the
property
mr
caldwell
did
not
look
around
i
i
m
afraid
that
s
impossible
he
answered
finally
he
s
away
ronnie
brought
his
knees
up
against
his
stomach
and
then
wrapped
his
arms
about
his
legs
to
hold
them
close
he
looked
over
at
caldwell
how
much
did
the
man
really
know
was
this
all
a
put
up
job
pretending
he
had
no
knowledge
of
his
relationship
to
jacob
williams
acting
as
if
he
didn
t
know
a
thing
so
ronnie
would
not
connect
him
with
his
mysterious
prowlings
about
the
village
ronnie
sighed
it
was
all
very
puzzling
but
somehow
he
couldn
t
believe
that
mr
caldwell
was
guilty
of
deceiving
them
ronnie
had
to
admit
to
himself
that
he
liked
the
man
the
room
had
grown
darker
off
in
the
distance
ronnie
heard
the
low
rumble
of
thunder
the
back
door
slammed
shut
and
mr
rorth
came
down
the
hallway
and
poked
his
head
into
the
room
hi
everyone
he
said
cheerfully
mr
caldwell
how
are
you
by
the
way
i
dropped
some
screen
doors
and
windows
off
at
your
place
but
i
didn
t
have
time
to
put
them
up
i
left
some
nails
and
a
hammer
though
and
you
can
tack
them
up
temporarily
many
thanks
caldwell
said
i
can
certainly
use
the
screens
i
never
knew
there
were
so
many
insects
in
the
world
until
i
came
here
too
bad
you
left
the
hammer
though
i
have
one
of
my
own
whose
hammer
ronnie
wondered
caldwell
s
or
was
it
the
one
that
had
disappeared
from
bill
s
barn
the
room
grew
another
shade
darker
a
brilliant
flash
of
lightning
dispelled
the
darkness
for
a
brief
moment
and
then
the
thunder
broke
the
house
vibrated
from
the
sound
mr
caldwell
moved
toward
the
door
i
d
best
be
going
before
the
storm
breaks
come
along
mr
rorth
offered
and
i
ll
take
you
most
of
the
way
in
the
truck
you
ll
never
make
it
before
it
rains
the
truck
was
hardly
out
of
sight
when
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
ronnie
at
the
living
room
window
watched
the
puddles
grow
deeper
and
deeper
the
rain
turned
to
hail
and
beat
against
the
pane
like
a
kettledrum
solo
a
streak
of
lightning
split
the
black
clouds
and
pierced
the
earth
almost
immediately
a
crack
of
thunder
seemed
to
explode
overhead
the
rain
fell
heavier
ronnie
turned
from
the
window
and
let
the
curtains
fall
back
into
place
grandfather
got
up
from
his
chair
i
might
as
well
do
a
little
dxing
while
i
wait
on
supper
to
be
served
up
he
announced
ronnie
does
that
sound
interesting
to
you
i
don
t
think
so
gramps
really
you
shouldn
t
dx
during
a
thunderstorm
fiddlesticks
rubbish
if
the
lightning
s
got
your
name
written
on
it
it
ll
strike
you
no
matter
what
besides
what
s
there
left
for
me
around
here
now
he
stomped
from
the
room
as
fast
as
his
cane
would
permit
phil
turned
over
heavily
on
the
couch
bringing
his
magazine
around
with
him
ronnie
watched
his
brother
for
a
moment
then
turned
and
left
the
room
he
went
upstairs
to
his
bedroom
because
he
could
think
of
nothing
better
to
do
for
a
while
he
stood
by
his
window
watching
the
storm
below
he
saw
his
father
s
truck
drive
into
the
yard
and
come
to
a
quick
stop
mr
rorth
got
out
and
ran
for
the
back
door
and
down
in
the
deserted
village
ronnie
saw
another
figure
running
in
the
rain
the
figure
appeared
out
of
the
trees
and
ran
toward
the
rear
wall
of
the
padlocked
building
it
disappeared
from
sight
behind
the
building
ronnie
waited
for
it
to
reappear
but
the
minutes
passed
without
another
movement
in
the
village
the
boy
remembered
great
great
grandfather
s
words
in
his
diary
his
body
lies
below
together
with
the
evidence
of
his
guilt
there
was
no
doubt
in
the
boy
s
mind
now
what
his
great
great
grandfather
had
meant
down
below
the
padlocked
building
of
course
and
ronnie
remembered
too
how
savagely
the
stranger
had
attacked
the
interior
of
the
building
that
afternoon
overturning
furniture
pounding
on
the
walls
scattering
the
papers
it
wouldn
t
be
long
ronnie
realized
before
the
man
would
begin
to
rip
up
the
floor
boards
bill
and
i
have
got
to
get
there
first
he
told
himself
chapter
the
thunderstorm
did
not
roll
away
to
bother
other
parts
of
the
country
as
thunderstorms
usually
do
instead
it
turned
into
a
steady
downpour
that
showed
no
signs
of
letting
up
the
barnyard
flooded
and
the
water
ran
down
the
driveway
in
small
streams
that
washed
away
the
gravel
and
left
gullies
along
the
edges
all
night
it
rained
and
when
ronnie
awoke
the
next
morning
it
was
still
coming
down
after
breakfast
the
boy
moved
from
one
room
to
the
next
trying
to
decide
what
to
do
he
was
worried
about
what
the
intruder
might
have
discovered
during
the
night
perhaps
by
now
he
had
found
the
money
and
glassware
and
had
already
left
the
village
with
his
loot
ronnie
made
up
his
mind
he
went
to
the
telephone
and
called
bill
he
told
him
about
the
figuring
he
had
done
how
he
believed
the
money
and
glassware
were
hidden
somewhere
beneath
the
padlocked
building
and
how
he
was
afraid
the
intruder
might
already
have
found
it
we
ve
got
to
work
fast
bill
he
said
urgently
i
m
with
you
ronnie
bill
agreed
i
can
get
away
i
think
can
you
i
ll
wear
boots
and
my
raincoat
and
cape
my
dad
ll
say
yes
for
sure
then
i
ll
see
you
there
and
bring
the
ledger
book
i
want
to
see
the
part
you
re
talking
about
meet
you
in
our
office
in
twenty
minutes
ronnie
went
to
find
his
father
to
get
permission
now
how
in
the
world
would
i
know
where
he
is
mrs
butler
protested
she
had
just
arrived
and
was
removing
her
plastic
raincoat
and
hat
go
look
in
the
barn
he
generally
works
there
when
the
weather
s
bad
like
this
ronnie
dashed
across
the
yard
and
sailed
through
the
open
barn
doors
he
found
his
father
at
his
workbench
cutting
tomato
poles
from
old
boards
on
his
power
saw
sure
go
ahead
mr
rorth
agreed
a
little
rain
s
not
going
to
hurt
anybody
ronnie
ran
back
to
the
house
he
went
up
to
his
room
and
got
the
ledger
then
he
got
his
boots
raincoat
and
rubber
raincape
from
the
hall
closet
phil
appeared
from
the
kitchen
where
are
you
heading
for
ronnie
he
asked
i
m
meeting
bill
down
at
the
village
want
to
come
phil
looked
at
ronnie
as
if
his
brother
had
asked
him
to
go
to
the
moon
are
you
kidding
he
laughed
i
wouldn
t
go
out
in
this
weather
if
the
house
was
on
fire
ronnie
slipped
the
ledger
under
his
raincoat
where
it
would
be
protected
from
the
weather
say
phil
demanded
what
s
that
just
a
book
ronnie
answered
he
wasn
t
going
to
take
the
time
now
to
explain
besides
phil
knew
so
little
about
what
had
happened
during
the
past
few
days
that
ronnie
would
have
to
start
at
the
beginning
if
his
brother
were
to
understand
how
important
the
book
was
yea
but
what
kind
of
a
book
phil
persisted
ronnie
retreated
toward
the
door
but
phil
followed
him
oh
an
old
book
i
found
in
the
padlocked
building
ronnie
admitted
finally
as
he
opened
the
door
and
stepped
out
onto
the
porch
say
he
heard
phil
exclaim
as
the
door
closed
on
his
words
something
s
going
on
around
here
ronnie
splashed
through
the
puddles
in
the
driveway
and
entered
the
orchard
the
rain
drummed
down
on
his
rubber
hood
little
rivers
drained
from
his
shoulders
he
held
the
book
tight
as
he
plunged
down
the
soggy
bluff
and
entered
the
trees
at
the
bottom
down
in
the
valley
he
breathed
deep
of
the
pungent
odor
of
pine
released
by
the
long
rain
off
to
the
right
partially
hidden
by
the
ground
fog
that
had
been
trapped
beneath
the
heavy
foliage
when
the
cooler
rain
touched
the
warm
earth
ronnie
saw
the
old
bakery
building
its
broken
crumbled
walls
and
sections
of
rotting
roof
seemed
unusually
deserted
and
lonely
in
the
faint
light
ronnie
shivered
suddenly
and
continued
down
the
narrow
path
wet
branches
snapped
back
against
his
raincoat
and
sprayed
water
into
his
face
he
stopped
a
moment
to
shift
the
ledger
higher
up
under
his
arm
and
then
suddenly
there
was
a
movement
in
the
bushes
at
the
side
of
the
path
before
the
boy
could
turn
someone
seized
him
from
behind
and
grasping
his
arms
pinned
them
behind
his
back
ronnie
felt
the
ledger
slipping
from
his
hold
it
started
to
fall
beneath
his
raincoat
he
struggled
to
free
himself
but
his
assailant
was
strong
he
tried
too
to
twist
his
head
about
so
he
could
see
who
it
was
but
his
raincape
blocked
his
vision
on
both
sides
all
right
kid
a
man
s
voice
growled
close
to
the
boy
s
ear
let
s
have
it
h
have
w
what
ronnie
gasped
the
book
i
saw
you
kids
looking
at
yesterday
in
that
shack
of
yours
the
man
tightened
his
grip
on
the
boy
s
arms
and
ronnie
winced
and
just
at
that
moment
the
ledger
slipped
to
the
ground
so
you
ve
got
it
with
you
eh
well
that
s
so
much
the
better
the
man
loosened
his
grip
somewhat
then
he
gave
ronnie
a
terrific
shove
that
sent
the
boy
sprawling
headlong
into
the
wet
leaves
ronnie
was
more
angry
than
he
was
hurt
he
had
just
one
idea
in
his
mind
to
get
a
close
look
at
this
man
now
that
he
had
the
opportunity
no
sooner
had
he
struck
the
ground
than
he
rolled
over
and
pulled
himself
up
to
a
sitting
position
the
man
was
bending
over
to
pick
up
the
ledger
but
when
he
straightened
up
he
was
facing
directly
toward
the
boy
ronnie
found
himself
face
to
face
with
his
opponent
mr
mr
caldwell
ronnie
exclaimed
the
man
s
thin
summer
clothes
were
soaked
to
the
skin
and
his
thick
straight
hair
was
matted
to
his
head
on
top
and
hanging
over
his
forehead
in
ropelike
strands
but
caldwell
paid
no
attention
to
the
boy
s
remark
book
in
hand
he
walked
off
down
the
path
in
the
direction
of
the
old
bakery
give
me
back
my
book
ronnie
shouted
after
him
why
why
you
he
took
off
after
the
man
leaping
onto
his
back
and
clinging
there
with
all
his
strength
but
he
was
no
match
for
caldwell
with
his
free
hand
the
man
released
the
boy
s
grip
from
about
his
neck
then
still
holding
ronnie
s
wrist
he
flung
the
boy
from
him
ronnie
sailed
into
the
bushes
rolled
over
several
times
and
came
to
a
stop
by
the
time
he
had
pulled
himself
to
his
feet
caldwell
had
disappeared
dejectedly
the
boy
turned
and
made
his
way
slowly
toward
their
office
to
tell
bill
the
disheartening
news
bill
had
the
door
unlocked
but
closed
to
keep
out
the
rain
and
chill
ronnie
came
inside
pulled
off
his
raincape
he
didn
t
have
to
tell
bill
that
something
unpleasant
had
happened
his
friend
read
it
in
ronnie
s
face
you
did
everything
you
could
have
done
bill
said
to
him
after
ronnie
had
told
him
the
story
don
t
feel
bad
about
it
bill
went
over
to
sit
on
the
edge
of
the
desk
so
it
has
been
caldwell
all
along
and
him
acting
so
sweet
and
nice
you
sure
ronnie
ronnie
nodded
it
was
him
all
right
of
course
he
looked
a
little
different
because
he
was
as
wet
as
a
drowned
rat
you
mean
he
wasn
t
wearing
a
raincoat
or
anything
like
that
nope
it
did
seem
strange
now
that
ronnie
had
time
to
think
about
it
certainly
caldwell
would
have
brought
enough
clothing
with
him
for
all
kinds
of
weather
but
hadn
t
he
seen
caldwell
face
to
face
raincoat
or
no
raincoat
it
was
mr
caldwell
all
right
well
now
what
do
we
do
he
asked
bill
why
just
what
we
planned
of
course
bill
explained
and
maybe
we
ve
got
the
jump
on
caldwell
after
all
because
why
would
he
take
the
ledger
from
you
if
he
had
found
the
money
and
glassware
or
knew
where
it
was
i
see
what
you
mean
ronnie
exclaimed
he
wouldn
t
need
the
ledger
if
he
was
close
to
finding
the
money
and
glassware
right
he
s
probably
getting
desperate
he
saw
us
with
the
old
book
and
decided
it
might
contain
an
answer
to
what
he
wanted
to
know
maybe
he
even
heard
us
reading
parts
of
it
ronnie
walked
over
to
the
window
streams
of
water
ran
down
from
the
roof
the
wind
was
lifting
now
and
the
trees
were
bending
under
its
force
ronnie
turned
to
face
his
friend
bill
if
i
hadn
t
seen
caldwell
face
to
face
i
don
t
think
i
could
believe
he
s
the
man
who
s
been
doing
all
this
snooping
and
you
know
even
while
he
was
grabbing
me
back
there
on
the
path
i
didn
t
think
it
was
him
he
just
didn
t
talk
like
caldwell
or
act
like
him
either
well
you
never
do
really
know
a
man
until
you
ve
been
around
him
a
good
long
while
that
s
what
my
pa
says
bill
pulled
his
raincape
over
his
head
we
re
just
wasting
time
sitting
here
and
talking
let
s
get
over
to
the
padlocked
building
i
brought
a
flashlight
did
you
bring
the
key
ronnie
patted
his
trouser
leg
right
here
in
my
pocket
he
exclaimed
they
closed
the
door
to
their
office
and
started
down
the
puddle
filled
path
the
rain
beat
against
their
raincapes
and
coats
and
overhead
the
trees
lashed
wildly
in
the
rising
wind
a
dead
branch
fell
to
the
path
behind
them
when
they
reached
the
cobblestone
road
they
saw
phil
coming
toward
them
huddled
inside
his
raincoat
and
pushing
against
the
wind
i
figured
something
was
up
he
said
to
bill
and
ronnie
when
he
had
reached
them
come
on
out
with
it
what
have
you
two
got
up
your
sleeves
and
where
s
that
old
book
you
had
ronnie
ronnie
glanced
at
his
friend
bill
nodded
that
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
he
didn
t
care
if
phil
was
brought
in
on
their
venture
so
while
they
walked
to
the
padlocked
building
bill
and
ronnie
supplied
phil
with
whatever
information
he
needed
to
bring
him
up
to
date
when
they
arrived
at
the
old
rorth
glassworks
office
building
ronnie
brought
the
key
from
his
pocket
and
inserted
it
in
the
rusty
lock
he
tried
to
turn
the
key
but
it
wouldn
t
budge
it
wouldn
t
turn
for
bill
or
phil
either
we
ll
have
to
use
caldwell
s
secret
trap
door
ronnie
said
and
they
hurried
around
to
the
rear
of
the
building
ronnie
removed
the
wall
section
and
the
three
climbed
through
bill
lit
his
flashlight
then
ronnie
closed
the
trap
door
again
because
as
he
explained
to
the
others
we
don
t
want
caldwell
to
know
we
re
in
here
bill
was
exploring
the
interior
with
the
flashlight
he
whistled
wow
caldwell
sure
turned
this
place
upside
down
ronnie
nodded
hardly
a
square
foot
of
the
floor
was
bare
of
paper
or
overturned
filing
cabinet
and
desk
drawers
even
a
few
floor
boards
here
and
there
were
torn
loose
looks
just
like
my
bedroom
when
mrs
butler
yells
at
me
phil
commented
we
ll
never
find
a
way
down
below
with
all
this
clutter
ronnie
remarked
maybe
we
should
clean
up
first
bill
agreed
and
the
three
set
to
work
picking
up
the
papers
and
stuffing
them
back
in
the
drawers
next
they
moved
all
the
furniture
to
one
side
of
the
room
and
returned
the
drawers
to
their
places
in
the
desk
and
filing
cabinet
now
we
ll
give
this
cleared
side
of
the
room
a
real
going
over
bill
said
then
we
ll
move
everything
to
the
other
side
and
search
that
part
come
on
phil
let
s
get
with
it
phil
was
lighting
matches
and
peering
under
the
floor
boards
caldwell
had
loosened
o
k
he
mumbled
they
started
in
the
corner
and
worked
systematically
back
and
forth
across
the
room
taking
a
few
boards
at
a
time
it
was
bill
s
idea
that
jacob
williams
had
made
some
sort
of
a
secret
trap
door
for
himself
and
that
if
the
boys
searched
carefully
enough
they
could
find
it
then
we
won
t
have
to
tear
up
any
more
of
the
floor
the
way
mr
caldwell
s
done
he
said
bill
was
working
with
his
penknife
at
the
rear
of
the
building
toward
the
fireplace
he
was
jabbing
into
the
wider
cracks
with
the
blade
and
then
prying
upward
hoping
to
dislodge
any
loose
section
suddenly
he
let
out
a
little
cry
of
triumph
phil
didn
t
hear
bill
because
he
was
inside
the
fireplace
lighting
more
matches
while
he
explored
but
ronnie
heard
him
and
came
over
to
find
out
what
he
had
discovered
look
ronnie
he
said
i
ve
got
these
boards
up
a
little
way
but
i
need
something
stronger
my
knife
ll
snap
if
i
push
any
harder
hold
everything
ronnie
directed
during
clean
up
ronnie
had
seen
a
pair
of
old
fire
tongs
leaning
against
the
fireplace
he
found
them
easily
in
the
dark
and
brought
them
to
bill
bill
examined
them
by
the
light
of
his
flashlight
the
ends
were
flattened
like
the
ends
of
a
screwdriver
just
the
implement
they
needed
bill
inserted
the
flattened
end
of
the
tongs
into
the
crack
removed
the
penknife
and
pushed
down
with
all
his
weight
then
he
pried
the
tongs
backward
a
section
of
the
flooring
began
to
move
upward
ronnie
grabbed
the
loose
end
and
pulled
an
entire
section
of
the
floor
came
free
zowie
bill
exclaimed
we
ve
found
it
chapter
bill
s
flashlight
broke
the
inky
blackness
beneath
the
opening
three
feet
below
the
floor
of
the
office
building
ronnie
saw
the
dry
hard
crusted
earth
on
which
the
footings
of
the
building
rested
into
this
for
a
distance
of
some
six
feet
beneath
the
trap
door
old
jacob
williams
had
dug
a
slanting
hole
that
ran
down
to
the
top
of
an
old
drainage
culvert
the
brick
arch
which
formed
the
roof
of
the
culvert
had
been
broken
through
below
the
break
through
the
culvert
ran
in
both
directions
parallel
to
the
side
of
the
building
wow
bill
exclaimed
playing
his
light
about
a
tunnel
and
it
s
plenty
high
enough
to
walk
through
too
i
ll
bet
it
used
to
carry
drainage
water
from
the
village
down
to
the
st
lawrence
ronnie
added
just
the
kind
of
place
jacob
williams
would
want
for
hiding
the
glassware
phil
hearing
the
excitement
came
over
and
crouched
down
beside
the
others
he
peered
over
the
edge
and
looked
down
into
the
hole
ronnie
was
trying
to
estimate
the
distance
to
the
bottom
of
the
culvert
he
figured
it
in
sections
from
the
floor
of
the
building
to
the
ground
level
was
a
crawl
space
of
about
three
feet
then
the
hole
jacob
williams
had
dug
was
another
six
feet
that
added
up
to
nine
feet
the
culvert
itself
at
the
highest
point
in
the
arch
was
another
six
or
seven
feet
fifteen
feet
to
ronnie
looking
down
into
the
blackness
it
seemed
more
like
a
hundred
and
fifteen
we
aren
t
thinking
of
going
down
there
are
we
phil
asked
i
suffer
from
claustrophobia
i
d
like
you
both
to
know
bill
looked
over
at
phil
and
we
suffer
just
hearing
you
talk
he
said
grinning
a
little
then
he
looked
at
ronnie
think
we
can
get
down
without
a
ladder
or
a
rope
he
asked
ronnie
studied
the
problem
yes
i
think
so
he
answered
finally
we
ll
take
it
in
stages
you
know
climb
down
there
to
the
ground
first
then
slide
down
the
hole
to
the
top
of
the
culvert
there
s
room
to
stand
there
then
we
can
swing
ourselves
down
through
the
opening
in
the
brickwork
phil
gulped
that
sounds
like
an
awful
lot
of
work
he
said
and
even
harder
to
get
up
again
nobody
s
twisting
your
arm
and
making
you
go
bill
said
ronnie
went
first
holding
bill
s
flashlight
the
others
waited
above
in
the
darkness
peering
over
the
edge
to
watch
ronnie
s
progress
ronnie
had
no
trouble
lowering
himself
to
the
ground
level
then
he
sent
the
light
from
the
flashlight
down
into
the
hole
williams
had
dug
the
remains
of
an
old
ladder
lay
in
pieces
along
the
sides
of
the
hole
ronnie
noticed
too
that
steps
had
been
made
leading
down
to
the
top
of
the
culvert
pieces
of
split
log
hammered
into
the
earth
but
protruding
far
enough
to
provide
a
foothold
the
boy
tried
the
first
one
it
sustained
his
weight
he
tried
another
and
another
he
looked
up
at
bill
and
phil
and
grinned
things
were
going
just
fine
he
smiled
too
soon
the
fourth
step
broke
under
his
weight
his
feet
flew
out
from
under
him
and
his
back
struck
the
side
of
the
hole
he
slid
the
rest
of
the
way
carrying
with
him
an
avalanche
of
dirt
and
pebbles
luckily
he
managed
to
keep
himself
from
plunging
through
the
opening
in
the
brickwork
and
down
into
the
culvert
you
all
right
he
heard
bill
calling
down
i
m
o
k
he
answered
his
voice
echoed
back
hollow
and
distant
from
within
the
culvert
he
sat
down
with
his
legs
hanging
over
the
edge
of
the
broken
brickwork
and
flashed
the
light
down
into
the
darkness
the
bottom
looked
sandy
silt
carried
there
by
the
drainage
water
over
many
years
there
was
no
way
to
climb
in
he
d
have
to
drop
he
tucked
the
flashlight
under
his
belt
beneath
his
raincoat
and
began
to
slip
forward
then
when
he
was
on
the
very
edge
he
let
his
body
fall
forward
he
struck
bottom
on
his
feet
but
the
momentum
threw
him
forward
and
he
landed
face
first
on
a
patch
of
slimy
sand
picking
himself
up
he
found
his
flashlight
and
pressed
the
button
light
bored
through
the
pitch
blackness
the
brick
walls
were
slimy
and
green
and
water
dripped
through
the
bricks
and
dropped
to
the
floor
in
places
sand
and
earth
had
seeped
through
the
cracks
in
the
masonry
and
had
formed
mounds
and
valleys
along
the
culvert
floor
he
looked
up
and
saw
bill
and
phil
peering
down
at
him
under
the
light
from
his
flashlight
what
s
it
like
down
there
bill
asked
kind
of
kind
of
spooky
he
answered
he
heard
his
voice
come
back
to
him
from
both
ends
of
the
culvert
i
ll
be
with
you
in
a
minute
bill
called
shine
the
light
along
the
way
five
minutes
later
both
phil
and
bill
had
joined
ronnie
in
the
culvert
nice
place
to
hold
a
halloween
party
phil
commented
i
m
kind
of
glad
now
that
i
decided
to
come
down
to
the
village
to
see
what
you
two
were
cooking
up
bill
retrieved
his
flashlight
from
ronnie
and
began
to
explore
the
culvert
with
it
wow
he
exclaimed
suddenly
take
a
look
over
where
the
light
s
pointing
ronnie
saw
a
crude
shelf
supported
by
sapling
logs
which
rested
on
the
culvert
floor
the
shelf
ran
for
six
to
seven
feet
along
the
side
of
the
wall
and
on
it
were
a
number
of
wooden
crates
protruding
from
the
excelsior
with
which
the
crates
were
packed
ronnie
could
see
a
number
of
glass
cannisters
goblets
decanters
and
flasks
of
different
colors
oh
boy
bill
exploded
he
ran
forward
and
removed
one
of
the
pieces
holding
out
a
beautiful
rose
tinted
goblet
of
frail
delicate
glass
around
the
belly
of
the
piece
ran
a
band
of
men
and
women
in
eighteenth
century
dress
etched
into
the
surface
like
autumn
frost
the
others
had
moved
to
the
shelf
too
hey
pig
phil
said
to
bill
how
about
sharing
some
of
that
light
so
we
can
get
a
look
at
some
of
this
stuff
too
bill
laid
the
light
on
the
shelf
and
pointed
it
so
ronnie
and
phil
could
use
it
too
ronnie
lifted
another
of
the
crates
to
the
floor
one
by
one
he
removed
a
set
of
six
wine
glasses
and
a
decanter
to
match
and
placed
them
on
the
floor
in
a
nest
of
excelsior
phil
however
had
his
eye
on
something
different
he
was
interested
in
a
small
metal
box
at
the
end
of
the
shelf
he
took
it
down
brushed
off
the
flakes
of
rust
and
tried
to
open
the
lid
it
was
rusted
fast
bill
had
reached
the
bottom
of
his
crate
and
now
he
was
carefully
packing
the
contents
back
as
he
had
found
them
he
turned
to
ronnie
it
s
not
going
to
be
easy
getting
these
crates
out
of
here
he
said
we
don
t
want
to
break
any
ronnie
nodded
i
know
yet
we
can
t
leave
them
here
for
caldwell
to
claim
one
of
us
will
have
to
go
for
a
rope
there
s
one
in
the
glassworks
building
that
we
were
using
to
haul
junk
outside
maybe
we
can
persuade
phil
to
go
and
get
it
fat
chance
of
doing
that
a
sudden
squeal
of
surprise
and
wonderment
from
phil
interrupted
their
discussion
phil
came
over
to
them
with
the
opened
metal
box
in
his
hands
boy
oh
boy
he
exclaimed
have
i
hit
real
pay
dirt
just
focus
your
eyes
on
what
s
inside
this
box
ronnie
peered
inside
while
phil
held
the
box
so
the
light
from
the
flashlight
could
reach
the
interior
th
the
money
ronnie
gasped
you
bet
it
s
the
money
phil
echoed
he
took
out
a
roll
of
bills
and
a
handful
of
gold
and
silver
coins
and
plenty
of
it
too
wow
bill
exclaimed
now
we
can
save
the
village
we
can
build
the
dam
how
much
is
there
phil
the
bills
had
been
rolled
and
tied
with
a
piece
of
cord
phil
opened
the
roll
easily
bill
got
the
flashlight
from
the
shelf
and
they
crouched
together
in
a
group
while
one
by
one
phil
laid
the
big
old
fashioned
bills
in
a
pile
there
were
mostly
twenties
and
hundreds
with
a
few
fives
and
tens
altogether
phil
counted
over
two
thousand
dollars
they
examined
the
gold
and
silver
coins
next
with
these
their
total
came
to
twenty
one
hundred
dollars
put
the
money
back
in
the
box
ronnie
directed
we
ve
got
to
work
fast
i
sure
feel
uneasy
about
mr
caldwell
coming
back
you
two
get
the
crates
over
underneath
the
opening
bill
said
and
i
ll
run
over
to
the
glassworks
and
get
the
rope
we
ll
have
this
stuff
out
of
here
and
locked
up
in
our
office
before
caldwell
even
knows
what
s
going
on
then
i
ll
ask
pa
to
come
down
with
the
truck
and
we
ll
take
it
up
to
your
house
ronnie
bill
had
some
trouble
getting
back
up
to
the
padlocked
building
but
he
finally
made
it
when
he
had
gone
ronnie
set
to
work
lifting
the
crates
from
the
shelf
and
carrying
them
over
to
the
floor
beneath
the
opening
phil
seemed
to
have
an
inexhaustible
supply
of
matches
and
he
left
ronnie
to
explore
up
the
culvert
by
the
time
ronnie
had
finished
phil
was
back
he
had
a
sheepish
look
on
his
face
but
he
was
a
little
pale
too
what
s
eating
you
ronnie
demanded
i
i
just
met
up
with
jacob
williams
phil
answered
i
mean
what
s
left
of
him
you
mean
you
mean
his
bones
are
down
there
ronnie
asked
motioning
in
the
direction
phil
had
just
come
from
it
really
shouldn
t
surprise
him
of
course
he
told
himself
great
great
grandfather
ezra
had
mentioned
in
his
diary
that
he
had
found
jacob
williams
body
down
below
and
that
he
didn
t
have
the
strength
to
get
him
up
when
bill
returned
with
the
rope
the
three
set
to
work
bringing
the
crates
up
to
the
padlocked
building
it
was
hard
exacting
work
one
end
of
the
rope
was
tied
to
a
rafter
in
the
building
and
the
other
end
fastened
securely
about
one
of
the
crates
then
it
was
a
matter
of
pulling
from
the
top
and
guiding
the
box
along
the
way
so
that
it
didn
t
crash
against
the
sides
at
any
time
in
all
there
were
six
crates
to
be
pulled
up
the
boys
had
removed
their
raingear
and
cumbersome
boots
but
by
the
time
they
had
finished
they
were
dripping
with
perspiration
and
covered
with
dirt
and
grime
but
even
phil
hadn
t
complained
there
they
were
at
last
the
six
crates
and
the
metal
box
piled
together
in
the
center
of
the
padlocked
building
the
rest
seemed
easy
in
comparison
two
trips
for
each
of
them
and
the
crates
would
be
safely
stored
in
their
office
ready
for
the
truck
to
pick
them
up
ronnie
was
all
smiles
as
he
and
the
others
stole
a
minute
or
two
of
their
precious
time
to
sit
down
and
catch
their
breaths
golly
he
said
i
never
once
thought
this
would
be
such
an
exciting
day
when
i
got
up
this
morning
neither
did
i
bill
agreed
when
i
saw
the
rain
pouring
down
i
thought
for
sure
i
was
in
for
a
real
boring
day
the
most
i
thought
we
d
get
done
was
to
maybe
clean
up
another
building
and
when
i
got
up
phil
added
i
told
myself
to
turn
around
and
go
back
to
sleep
bill
looked
over
at
phil
curiously
how
come
you
re
so
lazy
phil
phil
grinned
back
at
him
it
just
comes
naturally
i
guess
ronnie
got
up
he
was
on
pins
and
needles
for
fear
something
might
happen
before
they
got
the
money
and
glassware
safely
stowed
away
he
looked
over
at
the
crates
maybe
we
could
each
carry
two
of
them
he
suggested
and
make
it
all
in
one
trip
not
me
phil
protested
after
hauling
them
up
from
below
you
re
lucky
i
ll
agree
to
carry
one
phil
s
right
bill
agreed
we
wouldn
t
want
to
drop
and
break
anything
this
glassware
is
pretty
valuable
i
ll
bet
they
put
on
their
raingear
and
boots
then
each
selected
a
crate
and
moved
it
over
to
the
trap
door
in
the
rear
of
the
building
ronnie
set
his
down
so
he
could
remove
the
section
of
wall
he
didn
t
have
to
the
trap
door
suddenly
opened
as
if
by
itself
and
there
framed
in
the
opening
was
caldwell
s
face
and
shoulders
he
had
a
gun
in
his
hand
chapter
ronnie
s
heart
began
to
tap
dance
inside
his
chest
he
knew
too
that
his
mouth
was
open
as
wide
as
it
would
go
and
that
he
couldn
t
do
a
thing
to
close
it
caldwell
stepped
inside
holding
the
gun
loosely
in
his
hand
he
brought
a
flashlight
from
his
pocket
take
your
light
out
of
my
eyes
caldwell
commanded
bill
y
yes
sir
bill
managed
to
say
the
light
clicked
off
caldwell
s
took
its
place
it
was
focused
not
on
the
boys
but
on
the
pile
of
crates
left
in
the
middle
of
the
room
now
wasn
t
that
nice
of
you
boys
to
find
this
stuff
for
me
and
to
lug
it
up
too
of
course
you
had
a
slight
advantage
over
me
in
that
you
had
the
book
longer
than
me
but
i
figured
it
out
too
and
just
in
time
it
appears
ronnie
was
looking
at
a
different
caldwell
now
as
the
man
stood
framed
in
the
light
from
the
rear
trap
door
this
wasn
t
the
caldwell
he
had
known
during
the
past
days
this
was
a
cool
deliberate
scheming
caldwell
this
was
the
man
he
had
tangled
with
on
the
path
earlier
in
the
day
caldwell
backed
around
toward
the
crates
keeping
the
gun
and
light
trained
on
the
boys
with
the
gun
in
his
right
hand
and
the
flashlight
tucked
under
his
left
arm
he
threw
back
the
cover
to
the
metal
box
well
now
he
said
this
is
just
what
i
need
this
will
cover
my
traveling
expenses
very
nicely
with
plenty
left
over
besides
he
picked
up
the
bills
and
pushed
them
into
his
pocket
and
then
came
back
to
scoop
up
the
coins
you
boys
have
been
very
helpful
very
helpful
and
since
you
ve
gone
to
all
the
trouble
of
carting
this
heavy
stuff
upstairs
for
me
i
might
as
well
take
it
along
too
there
s
always
some
sucker
antique
dealer
along
the
road
who
will
give
me
a
few
bucks
for
it
bill
took
a
step
forward
but
stopped
when
caldwell
s
gun
came
up
you
sure
have
had
us
fooled
mr
caldwell
bill
said
and
we
sure
were
fools
to
have
trusted
you
yea
sure
kid
caldwell
seemed
a
little
puzzled
by
what
bill
had
said
well
enough
of
this
it
ll
take
me
an
hour
to
get
loaded
and
hit
the
road
he
swung
the
light
around
searching
for
something
it
stopped
when
he
found
the
open
trap
door
leading
down
to
the
culvert
o
k
you
kids
he
ordered
supposing
you
climb
back
down
into
the
cellar
ronnie
s
eyes
widened
as
he
gathered
the
full
intent
of
the
order
you
you
re
not
going
to
lock
us
up
down
there
he
gasped
i
sure
am
kid
you
don
t
think
i
m
going
to
turn
you
loose
so
you
can
bring
the
whole
neighborhood
after
me
do
you
i
need
plenty
of
time
to
get
this
stuff
out
of
here
and
to
hit
the
road
now
get
moving
all
of
you
ronnie
stood
his
ground
i
won
t
go
he
said
stubbornly
why
we
d
never
get
out
of
there
nobody
would
ever
find
us
he
added
well
now
isn
t
that
too
bad
caldwell
sneered
now
move
before
i
push
you
down
if
that
s
the
way
you
want
it
we
d
better
go
bill
said
they
filed
dejectedly
toward
the
opening
in
the
floor
bill
went
first
and
ronnie
followed
before
taking
his
turn
phil
turned
to
caldwell
how
about
paying
us
for
bringing
the
stuff
up
anyway
huh
he
asked
don
t
get
funny
kid
my
name
s
phil
or
don
t
you
remember
look
kid
i
don
t
care
one
hoot
what
your
name
is
now
shake
it
up
before
i
help
you
when
phil
s
head
was
below
the
level
of
the
floor
caldwell
dropped
the
trap
door
into
place
ronnie
and
bill
stood
together
below
the
opening
watching
phil
descend
bill
holding
the
light
for
phil
to
see
by
above
they
heard
caldwell
driving
several
nails
into
the
trap
door
each
blow
echoed
down
the
long
lengths
of
the
tunnel
with
a
hollow
boom
then
suddenly
it
was
silent
again
a
deep
silence
that
told
them
how
far
away
from
escape
they
really
were
ronnie
shivered
behind
him
he
heard
the
steady
rhythmic
dripping
of
water
against
the
culvert
floor
he
thought
he
heard
bill
s
heart
beating
too
or
was
it
his
own
anybody
got
a
deck
of
cards
phil
asked
suddenly
and
bill
and
ronnie
laughed
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
ronnie
appreciated
his
brother
s
wisecracking
they
decided
then
that
the
first
thing
they
should
do
was
to
explore
the
entire
culvert
in
hopes
that
there
might
be
some
other
way
out
beside
the
trap
door
before
they
left
however
ronnie
climbed
to
test
the
strength
of
the
trap
door
hoping
that
perhaps
caldwell
s
nails
had
not
been
well
placed
it
was
an
idle
hope
the
trap
door
was
as
solid
as
the
rest
of
the
floor
their
explorations
revealed
that
one
end
of
the
culvert
ended
in
a
cave
in
the
other
end
sloping
rapidly
ran
to
the
river
and
was
flooded
and
that
water
s
rising
too
bill
said
to
ronnie
as
they
made
their
way
back
all
this
rain
is
flooding
the
river
and
the
higher
the
river
gets
the
higher
the
water
backs
up
in
here
ronnie
was
almost
afraid
to
ask
the
question
that
had
come
to
his
mind
do
you
suppose
could
the
whole
culvert
get
flooded
bill
took
ronnie
and
phil
over
to
the
wall
and
showed
them
several
lines
of
dried
slime
which
had
impregnated
the
brick
each
one
of
those
lines
he
told
them
i
d
guess
was
a
water
level
mark
that
means
the
water
has
risen
pretty
high
one
thing
we
can
be
sure
of
though
is
that
the
water
has
never
reached
to
the
top
of
the
archway
not
yet
anyway
how
come
you
know
that
phil
asked
because
if
it
had
caldwell
wouldn
t
be
walking
off
with
that
roll
of
money
it
would
have
fallen
apart
i
wish
it
was
falling
apart
phil
grumbled
they
reached
that
section
of
the
culvert
below
the
building
here
they
selected
a
drier
area
of
floor
and
sat
down
with
their
backs
against
the
wall
bill
turned
off
the
flashlight
to
save
the
batteries
o
k
he
said
to
the
others
so
here
we
are
trapped
the
only
way
of
escape
is
nailed
shut
the
water
s
rising
how
far
we
don
t
know
yet
now
what
do
we
do
phil
s
voice
came
out
of
the
blackness
just
go
to
sleep
and
wait
until
somebody
finds
us
you
ll
sleep
until
doomsday
ronnie
told
his
brother
because
nobody
s
ever
going
to
find
us
here
except
for
us
the
only
one
who
knows
about
this
this
dungeon
is
mr
caldwell
and
it
doesn
t
look
as
if
he
s
going
to
tell
anyone
that
s
right
ronnie
bill
agreed
and
with
the
padlock
still
on
the
door
who
s
going
to
think
of
looking
inside
and
nobody
ll
hear
us
shouting
unless
they
do
come
inside
phil
added
i
yipes
what
s
the
matter
bill
demanded
and
switched
on
his
flashlight
he
picked
phil
out
of
the
darkness
phil
was
rubbing
at
the
back
of
his
neck
a
a
drop
of
cold
water
went
down
my
back
is
that
all
bill
grumbled
disgustedly
well
for
pity
s
sake
put
up
your
raincoat
collar
so
you
don
t
scare
me
like
that
again
and
don
t
yell
out
again
unless
it
s
something
serious
that
s
serious
i
could
catch
pneumonia
or
something
cut
it
out
phil
ronnie
protested
we
ve
got
to
think
can
t
you
get
it
through
your
thick
skull
that
we
re
in
serious
trouble
sure
i
can
i
just
want
to
die
smiling
i
think
jacob
s
skeleton
was
smiling
ronnie
was
tired
of
phil
s
chatter
and
he
was
tired
of
staring
into
the
blackness
and
seeing
nothing
too
so
he
closed
his
eyes
and
rested
his
head
back
against
the
hard
uneven
brick
he
wanted
to
think
but
he
couldn
t
rid
himself
of
the
feeling
that
he
was
all
alone
a
thousand
miles
down
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
he
put
his
hand
out
and
found
bill
s
shoulder
and
left
it
there
because
he
felt
some
comfort
in
knowing
that
his
friend
was
so
close
bill
shifted
his
position
closer
to
ronnie
keep
your
chin
up
ronnie
he
heard
bill
whisper
i
ve
got
an
idea
it
might
just
work
bill
leaned
over
closer
to
ronnie
so
his
mouth
was
only
a
few
inches
from
his
friend
s
ear
here
s
the
pitch
he
said
remember
the
first
end
of
the
culvert
we
visited
not
the
one
by
the
river
ronnie
nodded
yea
he
said
remembering
bill
couldn
t
see
him
and
remember
how
it
was
all
cave
in
just
a
big
mess
of
broken
brick
and
dirt
that
had
fallen
in
with
it
yea
ronnie
said
again
well
when
i
was
flashing
the
light
about
i
noticed
one
place
big
enough
to
crawl
up
into
it
looked
as
if
it
went
quite
a
way
toward
the
surface
now
i
was
thinking
maybe
we
could
dig
through
to
the
surface
from
there
hey
bill
that
s
a
cool
idea
let
s
try
it
but
what
ll
we
dig
with
i
can
jab
away
with
my
penknife
the
dirt
ll
keep
falling
down
into
the
culvert
let
s
go
ronnie
exclaimed
he
was
tired
of
sitting
he
wanted
to
do
something
to
help
them
escape
anything
bill
turned
on
his
light
phil
was
stretched
out
on
the
floor
with
his
eyes
closed
come
on
ronnie
nudged
him
we
ve
got
things
to
do
bill
explained
his
plan
to
phil
as
they
moved
down
the
culvert
phil
agreed
that
it
was
worth
the
try
they
reached
the
end
of
the
culvert
bill
played
the
beam
of
his
flashlight
about
among
the
giant
slabs
of
concrete
and
brick
that
had
tumbled
to
the
floor
of
the
culvert
inky
black
crevices
ran
upward
between
the
pieces
of
rubble
and
as
bill
moved
the
flashlight
about
looking
for
the
crevice
he
had
in
mind
the
jutting
ends
of
the
masonry
cast
weird
shadows
upon
the
walls
and
floor
there
it
is
bill
said
suddenly
holding
his
light
steady
that
s
the
one
see
how
far
up
it
goes
ronnie
saw
a
twisting
passage
which
gradually
grew
smaller
toward
the
top
halfway
up
a
giant
slab
almost
sealed
the
crevice
into
two
parts
but
ronnie
judged
that
there
would
possibly
be
room
for
bill
to
squeeze
past
bill
removed
his
raingear
and
handed
ronnie
the
flashlight
keep
the
light
where
i
need
it
he
instructed
then
he
boosted
himself
into
the
opening
and
began
to
worm
his
way
upward
protruding
edges
of
brick
and
mortar
gave
him
support
for
his
feet
or
a
hold
for
his
hands
soon
ronnie
saw
him
enter
the
narrow
aperture
bill
continued
to
edge
forward
forcing
his
shoulders
and
arms
between
the
two
giant
slabs
then
he
stopped
and
began
to
struggle
ronnie
could
see
that
he
was
wedged
tightly
between
the
two
slabs
h
help
i
i
m
caught
ronnie
heard
bill
s
muffled
voice
ronnie
slipped
out
of
his
raincoat
and
boots
and
handed
the
light
to
phil
then
he
grasped
the
ledge
of
the
lowest
block
of
masonry
and
pulled
himself
up
into
the
mouth
of
the
crevice
from
here
he
worked
his
way
upward
until
his
outstretched
hands
found
bill
s
shoes
he
took
a
firm
grip
about
his
friend
s
ankles
and
pulled
bill
s
body
did
not
budge
ronnie
might
just
as
well
have
tried
to
move
the
rubble
it
s
no
use
ronnie
bill
said
in
a
whimper
keep
your
chin
up
pal
ronnie
answered
i
ll
think
of
a
way
just
don
t
struggle
or
you
ll
swell
up
and
then
it
ll
be
even
harder
to
get
you
free
ronnie
lay
back
against
the
cold
stone
and
tried
to
catch
his
breath
and
think
he
had
to
find
a
way
to
free
bill
with
help
so
far
away
it
was
up
to
him
to
save
his
friend
a
section
of
brick
was
jabbing
into
his
back
just
under
the
shoulder
blades
he
shifted
his
position
to
ease
the
discomfort
his
shoulders
rubbed
against
a
section
of
smooth
slimy
moss
and
an
idea
came
to
him
he
d
read
stories
of
how
the
bodies
of
trapped
men
had
been
greased
and
then
had
slipped
out
quite
easily
the
nearest
grease
bucket
was
in
the
barn
but
wouldn
t
wet
slime
do
just
as
well
he
twisted
his
body
about
so
he
could
call
down
to
phil
get
me
a
good
big
handful
of
that
slime
down
at
the
other
end
of
the
culvert
and
hurry
phil
nodded
that
he
understood
he
turned
quickly
and
started
for
the
river
end
of
the
culvert
leaving
ronnie
in
the
pitch
black
ronnie
lay
back
against
the
rock
and
rested
above
him
he
heard
bill
s
forced
breathing
and
an
occasional
groan
he
heard
the
gentle
dripping
of
water
too
and
felt
something
crawling
down
the
back
of
his
shirt
it
seemed
an
eternity
before
phil
returned
with
both
hands
loaded
with
slime
the
flashlight
tucked
under
his
arm
ronnie
had
to
come
down
a
way
before
the
slime
could
be
transferred
to
his
own
hands
and
now
he
d
have
to
work
his
way
up
again
to
where
bill
was
caught
and
he
d
have
to
do
it
without
the
use
of
his
hands
it
wasn
t
going
to
be
easy
with
both
hands
cupping
the
precious
stuff
he
had
no
way
of
holding
on
he
managed
it
however
using
only
his
feet
and
elbows
now
his
head
was
alongside
bill
s
knees
and
he
could
reach
up
and
force
the
slime
between
the
rubble
and
his
friend
s
shoulders
bill
understood
what
ronnie
was
attempting
to
do
for
he
worked
his
body
about
to
spread
the
application
inch
by
inch
bill
squirmed
his
way
backward
and
suddenly
he
was
free
then
something
happened
that
ronnie
hadn
t
foreseen
bill
s
shoulders
came
free
so
unexpectedly
that
before
either
bill
or
ronnie
could
check
the
momentum
bill
had
lost
his
balance
his
body
slipped
backward
struck
the
side
of
a
concrete
slab
and
landed
on
the
culvert
floor
with
one
leg
doubled
under
him
phil
was
already
kneeling
beside
bill
s
body
by
the
time
ronnie
had
climbed
down
the
light
from
the
flashlight
was
on
bill
s
face
my
leg
oh
ronnie
my
leg
bill
groaned
and
grimaced
from
the
pain
sweat
broke
out
on
his
forehead
in
large
drops
his
lips
were
purple
blue
and
his
face
was
as
white
as
the
sweat
shirt
he
was
wearing
ronnie
bill
whispered
ronnie
please
do
something
for
me
please
do
something
chapter
ronnie
stooped
down
beside
his
friend
and
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
sure
bill
we
ll
have
you
fixed
up
in
no
time
he
said
he
took
bill
s
raincoat
and
covered
him
with
it
wrapping
it
around
underneath
as
far
as
he
dared
without
moving
the
injured
leg
then
he
set
to
work
massaging
bill
s
wrists
and
limbs
to
restore
the
circulation
and
all
the
while
he
worked
he
was
glad
for
those
hours
of
practice
and
study
that
he
d
given
to
learning
first
aid
at
scout
meetings
and
at
home
his
first
aid
merit
badge
was
proving
its
worth
he
looked
up
at
phil
down
the
culvert
i
saw
some
boards
that
must
have
washed
in
one
time
or
another
i
ll
need
a
couple
of
splints
go
get
them
phil
nodded
ronnie
handed
him
the
flashlight
and
his
brother
moved
off
down
the
culvert
ronnie
continued
chafing
bill
s
wrists
in
the
dark
he
could
feel
the
rapid
pulse
and
knew
that
his
friend
was
in
slight
shock
he
d
have
to
treat
that
first
the
leg
could
wait
he
continued
to
massage
bill
s
limbs
and
arms
phil
returned
with
an
armful
of
boards
ronnie
signaled
for
him
to
drop
them
and
to
take
over
the
job
that
he
had
been
doing
the
flashlight
showed
that
the
color
was
beginning
to
return
to
bill
s
face
his
pulse
was
slowing
down
to
normal
now
too
ronnie
got
up
and
came
around
to
kneel
by
bill
s
feet
he
swallowed
hard
this
was
going
to
be
a
real
tricky
job
straightening
out
bill
s
leg
without
compounding
the
fracture
ronnie
had
done
it
plenty
of
times
in
practice
but
then
there
had
been
no
broken
bones
that
could
jab
through
the
flesh
if
he
made
a
wrong
move
he
reached
in
under
the
raincoat
and
felt
his
way
forward
until
he
could
get
a
hold
on
bill
s
shoe
when
he
was
ready
he
instructed
phil
to
grasp
bill
around
the
armpits
and
to
lift
him
gradually
as
the
weight
of
bill
s
body
was
removed
from
the
leg
ronnie
took
a
firm
grip
about
bill
s
ankle
and
began
the
slow
tedious
task
of
straightening
the
leg
all
the
time
he
moved
the
leg
out
from
under
his
friend
s
body
he
applied
a
steady
forward
tension
to
keep
the
broken
bone
from
working
into
the
flesh
several
times
bill
cried
out
in
pain
now
the
leg
was
ready
for
splinting
ronnie
selected
several
of
the
longer
boards
he
ripped
sections
from
his
own
shirt
and
placed
these
against
bill
s
leg
and
laid
the
boards
gently
on
top
then
he
tore
strips
of
cloth
and
bound
them
about
the
boards
and
the
leg
until
the
splints
were
firmly
in
place
only
then
did
he
realize
that
he
was
soaking
wet
from
perspiration
and
that
he
was
shivering
from
nervous
tension
there
he
said
to
bill
i
guess
that
ll
hold
you
until
we
get
rescued
bill
smiled
weakly
thanks
pal
he
said
ronnie
turned
to
his
brother
think
we
can
carry
him
back
to
the
spot
where
we
came
in
we
probably
can
phil
answered
but
i
don
t
think
we
ought
to
you
see
the
river
s
risen
since
you
were
there
and
that
part
of
the
tunnel
s
under
a
foot
of
water
now
ronnie
tried
desperately
not
to
let
bill
know
how
frightened
he
was
then
then
we
ll
put
bill
up
on
that
shelf
where
the
crates
of
glassware
used
to
be
o
k
phil
answered
that
sounds
like
a
good
idea
because
it
isn
t
going
to
be
long
before
the
whole
culvert
s
covered
with
water
it
s
coming
in
fast
ronnie
wished
his
brother
could
see
his
face
so
phil
would
know
what
he
was
thinking
of
all
the
stupid
things
to
let
bill
hear
it
would
be
simple
for
ronnie
and
phil
to
climb
to
a
safe
level
in
the
crawl
space
beneath
the
building
but
never
in
a
million
years
could
they
get
bill
up
there
and
bill
wouldn
t
know
of
course
that
ronnie
would
never
leave
him
behind
no
matter
how
high
the
water
rose
they
brought
bill
down
the
culvert
without
too
much
difficulty
and
lifted
him
up
onto
the
shelf
where
he
could
lie
down
there
was
room
for
phil
and
ronnie
to
sit
too
and
although
they
had
their
boots
on
they
preferred
this
to
standing
in
the
water
now
that
bill
had
been
taken
care
of
ronnie
had
time
to
think
about
plans
for
their
escape
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
shelf
with
his
feet
dangling
over
the
edge
and
watched
the
water
swirl
in
from
the
river
he
could
go
back
and
continue
the
plan
that
bill
had
been
attempting
before
his
accident
but
somehow
ronnie
doubted
the
wisdom
of
this
there
must
be
a
better
way
he
looked
over
at
phil
got
any
ideas
he
asked
ideas
about
what
ideas
about
getting
out
of
here
of
course
not
right
offhand
phil
answered
but
i
ll
think
on
it
ronnie
didn
t
want
to
count
too
heavily
on
that
phil
had
never
been
one
for
finding
a
way
out
of
a
scrape
phil
had
always
relied
upon
his
brother
for
an
answer
or
he
had
just
simply
evaded
the
issue
completely
if
that
were
possible
bill
raised
his
head
a
few
inches
and
placed
his
arm
underneath
to
support
himself
don
t
try
my
idea
he
said
it
just
won
t
work
nobody
but
the
thin
man
from
the
circus
could
get
through
that
opening
i
don
t
intend
to
ronnie
answered
except
maybe
as
a
last
resort
yea
phil
said
and
by
that
time
you
ll
be
thin
enough
to
squeeze
through
ronnie
smiled
a
little
at
phil
s
remark
he
turned
off
the
flashlight
to
save
the
batteries
we
ve
certainly
made
a
mess
of
everything
haven
t
we
bill
s
voice
reached
ronnie
from
out
of
the
darkness
let
the
glassware
and
money
slip
right
out
of
our
hands
got
ourselves
trapped
down
here
me
with
a
busted
leg
and
i
guess
we
re
about
as
far
from
saving
the
village
as
we
ever
were
well
my
pa
says
it
s
always
darkest
before
the
dawn
maybe
things
will
get
better
from
here
on
the
silence
closed
in
again
except
for
the
steady
dripping
of
water
against
the
flooded
floor
it
sounded
to
ronnie
as
if
a
hundred
distant
bells
of
different
pitch
were
all
ringing
at
the
same
time
it
was
hard
sitting
here
in
the
darkness
waiting
wondering
if
they
d
ever
get
out
again
ronnie
bill
asked
you
suppose
our
folks
are
out
looking
for
us
now
maybe
depending
on
how
late
it
is
i
ve
lost
all
idea
of
the
time
nobody
ll
ever
find
us
down
here
bill
continued
they
won
t
even
look
inside
the
padlocked
building
because
they
ll
see
that
the
lock
s
still
on
the
door
i
wish
we
could
attract
their
attention
somehow
i
ve
got
plenty
of
matches
left
phil
announced
want
me
to
burn
down
the
building
nobody
could
miss
seeing
that
ronnie
wasn
t
sure
if
phil
was
being
serious
or
if
this
was
another
of
his
attempts
at
humor
whichever
it
was
ronnie
couldn
t
go
along
with
his
brother
s
suggestion
with
the
building
on
fire
the
culvert
was
sure
to
fill
with
smoke
and
fumes
perhaps
to
the
point
where
it
might
suffocate
them
no
phil
he
told
his
brother
that
s
too
risky
then
how
about
just
burning
through
the
trap
door
phil
added
how
about
that
ronnie
found
himself
shaking
his
head
no
phil
it
would
never
stop
with
the
trap
door
besides
i
don
t
think
we
ve
got
enough
kindling
to
get
it
started
no
we
ve
got
to
think
of
a
better
way
then
how
about
you
putting
out
with
a
few
phil
demanded
of
his
brother
maybe
i
can
if
you
ll
keep
quiet
for
a
few
minutes
ronnie
rested
his
chin
on
his
palm
and
braced
his
elbow
on
top
of
his
leg
he
stared
into
the
blackness
there
was
some
merit
to
phil
s
idea
not
fire
of
course
that
was
too
dangerous
but
some
kind
of
a
signal
that
could
be
seen
at
a
distance
he
thought
over
all
the
different
ways
of
signaling
he
d
ever
heard
of
there
were
whistles
and
bells
and
horns
there
were
lights
and
radio
beams
flags
hands
smoke
the
indians
had
used
smoke
signals
ronnie
stiffened
straightening
up
he
let
out
a
little
high
pitched
sound
of
approval
ronnie
bill
asked
you
all
right
ronnie
sure
i
m
all
right
i
just
had
an
idea
that
might
work
i
guess
i
surprised
myself
with
it
you
sounded
like
something
bit
you
phil
grumbled
let
s
hear
your
idea
ronnie
bill
said
well
remember
right
after
caldwell
nailed
the
trap
door
shut
i
went
up
to
test
how
strong
it
was
while
i
was
there
i
saw
a
little
metal
door
in
the
base
of
the
fireplace
you
know
a
door
to
an
ash
box
sure
ronnie
sure
bill
said
excitedly
we
ve
got
one
in
our
fireplace
down
in
the
cellar
well
my
idea
is
to
build
a
real
smoky
fire
in
the
box
it
ll
travel
up
to
the
fireplace
and
then
on
up
the
chimney
i
hope
that
s
a
great
idea
bill
exclaimed
i
sure
wish
i
could
help
you
with
it
we
ll
need
kindling
ronnie
went
on
there
s
more
of
that
where
phil
got
your
splints
but
the
real
problem
is
finding
something
that
ll
give
a
lot
of
thick
smoke
and
won
t
burn
up
too
quickly
like
rubber
phil
said
say
phil
you
re
really
using
your
brains
at
last
ronnie
exclaimed
and
rubber
s
something
we
ve
got
plenty
of
three
raincoats
three
pairs
of
boots
and
the
soles
off
our
shoes
too
if
we
need
them
i
ve
got
a
penknife
bill
said
his
enthusiasm
mounting
as
the
pain
in
his
leg
subsided
you
can
cut
the
rubber
into
chunks
and
then
feed
them
into
the
fire
why
with
the
supply
we
ve
got
we
can
keep
a
signal
fire
going
for
hours
and
hours
they
set
to
work
immediately
bill
found
he
could
help
too
after
he
had
pulled
himself
up
to
a
sitting
position
he
used
the
knife
to
cut
up
the
heavier
pieces
of
boots
phil
and
ronnie
worked
at
the
raincoats
ripping
the
fabric
first
into
strips
and
then
into
smaller
pieces
soon
they
had
a
large
pile
between
them
in
the
middle
of
the
shelf
phil
waded
down
the
culvert
to
gather
kindling
in
the
meantime
ronnie
took
off
his
torn
shirt
and
tying
a
knot
about
the
neck
end
used
the
piece
of
clothing
as
a
sack
to
carry
the
chunks
of
rubber
while
he
climbed
to
the
crawl
space
above
phil
joined
him
in
front
of
the
ash
box
a
few
minutes
later
all
i
could
find
was
wet
wood
he
told
ronnie
the
floodwater
has
picked
it
all
up
we
ll
need
something
dry
to
get
the
fire
started
ronnie
inspected
the
wood
phil
had
brought
yes
i
guess
you
re
right
we
ll
have
to
take
part
of
the
shelf
suppose
you
go
down
and
rip
off
a
few
boards
you
take
the
flashlight
i
think
i
can
manage
in
the
dark
it
wasn
t
easy
breaking
up
the
wood
in
the
darkness
he
was
continually
hitting
his
head
on
the
low
floor
beams
but
by
the
time
phil
returned
with
the
flashlight
and
several
pieces
of
dry
wood
ronnie
had
most
of
the
work
done
then
suddenly
there
were
sounds
overhead
footsteps
creaking
across
the
floor
a
muffled
murmur
of
voices
ronnie
drew
a
deep
breath
and
let
it
all
out
in
a
shout
dad
dad
we
re
down
here
bust
a
hole
in
the
floor
if
you
can
t
find
the
trap
door
yelled
phil
ronnie
s
heart
beat
wildly
as
he
heard
the
screech
of
nails
being
pulled
from
the
wood
the
trap
door
was
lifted
phil
uttered
a
soft
groan
of
relief
and
then
an
all
too
familiar
voice
said
harshly
o
k
down
you
go
for
a
moment
the
two
boys
stood
frozen
then
with
a
swiftness
amazing
for
him
phil
pointed
the
flashlight
at
the
trap
door
caldwell
was
standing
near
the
opening
motioning
with
his
gun
to
someone
in
the
shadows
behind
him
as
the
light
struck
him
caldwell
made
a
low
snarling
sound
and
whirled
around
to
level
his
gun
at
the
boys
below
put
out
that
light
he
commanded
phil
obeyed
hastily
but
in
the
split
second
it
had
taken
him
to
find
the
switch
a
second
man
had
stepped
into
the
light
ronnie
gasped
he
knew
from
phil
s
simultaneous
gasp
that
he
had
not
been
dreaming
there
were
two
mr
caldwells
chapter
huddled
together
in
the
dark
the
two
boys
and
the
man
heard
the
thud
of
the
trap
door
as
it
was
dropped
the
ring
of
a
hammer
against
the
nails
being
driven
back
into
the
wood
nobody
spoke
ronnie
was
conscious
of
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
man
who
had
joined
them
in
their
prison
of
phil
s
shoulder
pressing
against
his
as
though
for
reassurance
in
the
building
above
there
were
footsteps
again
an
occasional
thump
and
scrape
as
though
something
were
being
dragged
across
the
floor
toward
the
opening
in
the
wall
for
several
moments
there
would
be
silence
then
the
sounds
would
begin
again
the
glass
said
ronnie
at
last
he
s
taking
the
glass
away
and
he
s
got
the
money
phil
moaned
suddenly
ronnie
was
angry
he
grabbed
the
flashlight
from
phil
and
turned
it
full
on
their
companion
who
are
you
he
demanded
furiously
and
who
s
that
guy
upstairs
caldwell
winced
then
put
his
hand
firmly
on
the
flashlight
and
lowered
it
so
that
the
beam
would
not
blind
him
one
minute
he
said
softly
losing
our
heads
won
t
help
you
know
me
the
man
upstairs
is
my
twin
brother
the
black
sheep
of
the
family
i
guess
you
d
call
him
oh
said
ronnie
and
phil
together
ronnie
saw
the
whole
picture
now
he
had
felt
all
along
that
the
man
who
had
attacked
him
on
the
trail
and
stolen
the
ledger
couldn
t
be
the
caldwell
he
knew
he
d
felt
the
difference
at
the
time
but
what
was
he
to
think
the
two
men
were
identical
in
appearance
larry
arrived
the
same
time
i
did
caldwell
went
on
the
sounds
above
had
ceased
and
the
cut
out
piece
of
wall
had
been
put
back
into
place
but
until
today
i
had
no
idea
that
he
was
here
he
appeared
at
my
cottage
late
this
morning
and
demanded
the
keys
to
the
station
wagon
when
i
refused
he
threatened
me
with
a
gun
your
own
brother
pulled
a
gun
on
you
ronnie
asked
in
amazement
something
went
wrong
with
larry
caldwell
answered
seriously
he
s
been
in
trouble
all
his
life
in
fact
he
escaped
from
the
state
penitentiary
last
week
he
did
phil
exclaimed
golly
a
convict
right
here
in
the
village
and
we
never
even
guessed
but
why
did
he
hide
out
here
asked
ronnie
i
figure
he
had
two
things
in
mind
said
caldwell
first
since
the
deserted
village
has
been
opened
to
tourists
nobody
would
think
of
looking
here
for
an
escaped
convict
if
he
saw
anybody
coming
there
would
be
plenty
of
buildings
to
hide
in
second
larry
was
obsessed
all
his
life
by
that
old
story
about
the
stolen
rorth
glassware
and
the
money
and
the
murder
he
said
he
knew
the
glass
must
be
hidden
somewhere
because
it
had
never
showed
up
on
the
market
well
said
ronnie
glumly
he
was
right
he
s
got
it
now
and
the
money
too
and
the
old
diary
that
proves
great
great
grandfather
didn
t
murder
his
partner
mr
caldwell
wasn
t
interested
in
the
murder
or
the
money
glass
he
exclaimed
rorth
glassware
you
mean
larry
found
some
here
crates
of
it
said
phil
only
ronnie
and
bill
and
i
found
it
that
s
how
come
we
re
down
here
so
we
can
t
tell
on
him
rorth
glass
moaned
caldwell
and
here
we
are
where
it
won
t
even
do
us
a
bit
of
good
to
think
about
it
i
guess
that
s
why
larry
put
me
down
here
too
he
knew
i
d
move
heaven
and
earth
to
get
it
out
of
his
hands
he
s
probably
miles
away
in
your
station
wagon
by
now
said
ronnie
the
mild
mannered
caldwell
suddenly
turned
and
gripped
ronnie
by
the
shoulders
look
he
said
fiercely
we
ve
got
to
get
out
of
here
it
was
nearly
midnight
when
larry
brought
me
here
he
had
me
driving
him
around
for
hours
looking
for
a
road
he
could
use
to
get
through
the
police
road
blocks
then
after
we
found
an
old
abandoned
logging
road
he
had
me
drive
back
here
so
he
could
pick
up
the
loot
and
put
me
down
here
where
i
couldn
t
contact
the
police
it
will
be
daylight
soon
folks
will
be
up
and
about
before
long
isn
t
there
any
way
we
can
let
them
know
we
re
here
if
we
all
yelled
at
once
do
you
think
they
d
hear
us
the
smoke
signal
ronnie
exclaimed
and
at
once
began
to
break
up
the
dry
wood
phil
had
brought
at
the
same
time
he
explained
their
plan
to
caldwell
who
thought
it
a
good
idea
they
won
t
miss
it
he
said
the
whole
town
s
been
looking
for
you
kids
since
yesterday
afternoon
they
ve
scoured
the
village
for
you
twice
to
my
knowledge
but
of
course
nobody
thought
to
look
underground
ronnie
grinned
despite
his
anxiety
boy
he
said
will
we
have
a
story
to
tell
then
he
sobered
if
only
that
guy
hadn
t
gotten
away
with
the
glass
and
the
money
i
ve
a
feeling
he
won
t
get
far
said
caldwell
there
s
been
an
alarm
out
for
him
ever
since
he
escaped
the
police
don
t
fool
around
in
cases
like
this
my
main
concern
is
how
we
get
out
of
this
place
what
can
i
do
to
help
nothing
frankly
said
ronnie
phil
and
i
will
tend
to
the
smoke
signals
there
s
nothing
else
to
do
unless
you
want
to
go
back
and
keep
bill
company
he
explained
what
had
happened
to
bill
s
leg
and
caldwell
was
only
too
glad
to
do
what
he
could
to
cheer
the
boy
tell
him
said
ronnie
we
ll
be
out
of
here
before
he
knows
it
phil
held
the
flashlight
while
ronnie
showed
caldwell
the
best
way
down
to
the
culvert
then
the
two
boys
turned
back
to
their
work
phil
held
the
flashlight
against
the
ash
box
while
ronnie
inspected
it
the
iron
door
was
rusted
but
not
enough
to
prevent
ronnie
from
swinging
it
open
it
squealed
and
protested
and
showers
of
rust
flakes
fell
to
the
ground
ronnie
poked
the
light
inside
and
held
his
face
to
the
opening
there
s
an
opening
at
the
top
he
said
to
phil
it
must
go
all
the
way
up
into
the
fireplace
or
else
how
did
the
ashes
get
down
to
the
box
using
bill
s
knife
ronnie
shaved
some
of
the
kindling
wood
into
tiny
splinters
he
placed
these
in
the
ash
box
first
arranging
them
carefully
so
there
was
sufficient
air
space
between
each
piece
over
these
in
tepee
style
he
placed
the
larger
pieces
of
dry
wood
all
ready
for
the
match
he
told
phil
reaching
for
one
let
me
do
it
phil
insisted
they
re
my
matches
and
where
would
we
be
now
if
i
hadn
t
grabbed
a
pocketful
this
morning
ronnie
didn
t
argue
the
point
he
watched
his
brother
apply
the
flame
to
the
kindling
and
saw
the
fire
creep
upward
into
the
larger
pieces
so
far
so
good
ronnie
exclaimed
the
orange
light
from
the
fire
was
reflected
in
phil
s
face
let
s
put
all
the
dry
wood
on
first
and
get
as
hot
a
fire
as
we
can
then
we
ll
use
the
wet
stuff
soon
they
had
quite
a
blaze
going
in
the
ash
box
it
crackled
and
sputtered
and
the
metal
banged
every
once
in
a
while
as
it
expanded
from
the
heat
the
wet
wood
dampened
the
fire
considerably
after
it
was
applied
but
as
the
pieces
dried
out
from
the
heat
they
too
caught
and
burned
fiercely
now
we
re
ready
for
the
rubber
ronnie
announced
later
he
tossed
the
first
piece
into
the
fire
it
sputtered
for
a
moment
melting
about
the
edges
a
thick
cloud
of
inky
black
smoke
filled
the
ash
box
and
crowded
into
the
opening
at
the
top
ronnie
threw
in
a
few
more
pieces
and
then
slammed
the
door
shut
to
keep
the
smoke
inside
now
all
we
can
do
is
wait
ronnie
said
to
his
brother
and
throw
on
more
rubber
phil
added
and
maybe
pray
a
little
ronnie
said
if
this
didn
t
work
what
else
was
there
left
for
them
to
try
ronnie
phil
asked
softly
yes
how
long
can
people
live
without
food
and
water
phil
must
have
been
reading
his
mind
ronnie
thought
he
d
been
asking
himself
the
same
question
seems
to
me
i
read
that
people
live
longer
without
food
than
they
can
without
water
that
s
good
because
we
have
plenty
of
water
phil
switched
off
the
flashlight
some
light
leaked
through
the
cracks
around
the
door
of
the
ash
box
seems
to
me
we
ought
to
purify
the
water
before
we
drink
it
ronnie
said
he
opened
the
door
a
bit
to
peer
inside
at
the
fire
the
rubber
was
burning
slowly
and
the
pieces
that
were
now
in
the
fire
should
last
for
quite
a
while
the
heck
with
all
that
trouble
phil
answered
in
an
emergency
like
this
we
can
drink
the
water
the
way
it
is
it
should
be
sterilized
if
we
can
find
a
way
to
do
it
ronnie
insisted
well
i
m
dying
of
thirst
right
now
phil
said
he
panted
like
a
dog
to
illustrate
to
ronnie
how
much
he
needed
a
drink
think
i
ll
go
down
and
get
one
try
to
hold
off
for
a
while
huh
phil
ronnie
asked
him
maybe
we
can
boil
some
water
over
this
fire
sure
phil
growled
i
ll
hold
it
in
my
cupped
hands
while
it
heats
up
be
sensible
ronnie
you
know
we
ve
got
nothing
to
heat
it
in
but
despite
his
arguing
phil
apparently
decided
to
follow
ronnie
s
advice
he
made
no
move
to
go
below
instead
he
switched
the
flashlight
on
again
and
picking
up
bill
s
penknife
began
to
jab
at
the
floor
boards
over
his
head
who
knows
he
said
maybe
i
can
cut
a
hole
through
and
we
can
climb
out
but
after
five
minutes
of
jabbing
and
poking
and
scraping
phil
had
made
a
hole
no
bigger
than
a
fifty
cent
piece
and
hardly
as
deep
darnedest
wood
i
ever
cut
into
he
complained
oak
maybe
or
chestnut
ronnie
answered
he
opened
the
door
to
the
ash
box
and
threw
in
another
piece
of
rubber
lumber
was
cheap
in
those
days
phil
they
didn
t
skimp
on
buildings
the
way
dad
says
they
do
today
i
ll
bet
those
boards
are
an
inch
and
a
half
thick
and
you
d
need
a
hole
a
foot
across
before
we
could
slip
through
i
d
need
one
a
foot
and
a
half
phil
grinned
he
went
on
working
with
the
knife
doubling
his
efforts
by
jabbing
at
the
wood
from
a
greater
distance
and
with
more
speed
now
i
went
and
did
it
he
said
disgustedly
the
knife
blade
had
snapped
near
the
hinge
he
threw
the
broken
piece
of
blade
on
the
hard
dry
earth
and
stomped
on
it
in
anger
why
the
heck
did
i
have
to
try
so
hard
he
asked
i
m
always
messing
things
up
ronnie
wanted
to
scold
his
brother
for
being
so
careless
with
the
knife
but
he
bit
his
lip
and
kept
quiet
they
still
had
the
small
blade
if
as
a
last
resort
they
needed
a
knife
and
the
way
things
were
going
it
looked
as
if
they
were
going
to
have
to
think
of
some
other
way
to
free
themselves
at
least
an
hour
had
passed
since
ronnie
had
thrown
on
the
first
piece
of
rubber
and
the
black
smoke
had
rolled
up
the
chimney
why
hadn
t
someone
come
was
the
smoke
finding
a
way
to
the
top
of
the
flues
or
was
it
rolling
out
into
the
room
overhead
they
decided
then
that
they
d
take
turns
at
keeping
the
fire
fed
they
drew
splinters
of
wood
to
see
which
of
them
would
go
first
phil
drew
the
short
one
you
ll
need
more
kindling
from
time
to
time
ronnie
told
phil
as
he
prepared
to
go
below
and
stretch
out
a
bit
on
the
shelf
and
maybe
talk
to
bill
or
get
some
sleep
want
me
to
bring
some
up
i
ll
get
it
when
i
need
it
phil
replied
there
s
still
some
of
this
wet
stuff
left
say
who
gets
the
flashlight
i
ll
need
it
to
get
down
below
ronnie
said
so
i
ll
light
your
way
for
you
from
here
look
ronnie
if
i
don
t
get
the
light
i
don
t
tend
the
fire
then
when
you
take
over
you
ll
get
the
light
o
k
ronnie
agreed
see
you
later
the
long
hours
dragged
by
with
each
one
that
passed
ronnie
s
faith
in
the
smoke
signals
he
had
devised
grew
less
and
less
twice
he
relieved
phil
more
wood
had
to
be
taken
from
the
shelf
and
now
there
was
barely
room
enough
for
bill
to
sit
upright
the
water
pouring
in
from
the
st
lawrence
had
risen
another
three
feet
soon
the
top
of
the
shelf
would
be
awash
and
still
worse
their
supply
of
rubber
was
getting
low
soon
we
ll
have
to
cut
up
the
soles
of
our
shoes
ronnie
said
why
doesn
t
someone
come
i
think
it
s
probably
still
dark
out
phil
said
and
no
one
can
see
the
smoke
unless
they
re
close
by
ronnie
had
lost
all
sense
of
time
and
no
one
among
them
had
a
watch
he
d
slept
a
few
times
when
he
wasn
t
tending
the
fire
short
naps
during
which
he
was
more
awake
than
asleep
sometime
later
they
used
the
small
blade
of
bill
s
knife
to
cut
the
heels
and
rubber
soles
from
their
shoes
phil
went
up
with
ronnie
to
feed
some
of
it
into
the
fire
they
lay
on
their
sides
before
the
ash
box
phil
picked
up
some
of
the
soft
powdery
earth
and
watched
it
sift
through
his
fingers
i
wish
i
could
eat
this
stuff
he
said
i
wish
i
could
eat
something
ronnie
nodded
i
m
hungry
too
he
admitted
it
seems
like
days
and
days
that
we
ve
been
down
here
ronnie
dropped
off
to
sleep
for
a
while
waking
only
long
enough
to
place
another
piece
or
two
of
the
rubber
into
the
fire
soon
the
last
piece
was
gone
that
s
it
he
said
to
phil
that
s
all
there
is
but
phil
didn
t
hear
him
he
was
asleep
ronnie
sat
up
and
opening
the
door
of
the
ash
box
watched
the
last
piece
of
rubber
burn
away
to
nothing
soon
nothing
remained
within
the
box
but
a
few
black
cold
cinders
now
what
he
asked
himself
what
was
there
left
to
try
if
only
he
had
a
tool
of
some
kind
a
pick
or
a
shovel
with
the
pick
he
could
smash
a
way
through
the
stout
floor
boards
with
the
shovel
he
could
dig
to
the
surface
but
he
didn
t
have
a
pick
or
a
shovel
all
he
had
was
bill
s
broken
penknife
the
little
blade
was
left
of
course
but
it
wasn
t
strong
enough
for
such
a
giant
job
as
cutting
through
the
trap
door
or
the
floor
but
perhaps
it
would
be
better
than
doing
nothing
better
than
just
waiting
and
hoping
it
would
take
a
long
long
time
one
little
splinter
of
wood
after
another
minute
after
minute
hour
after
hour
being
very
careful
not
to
get
angry
as
phil
had
done
and
break
another
blade
eventually
he
might
get
through
if
his
strength
lasted
he
chose
a
spot
where
there
were
no
knots
and
the
wood
looked
softest
chip
after
chip
he
removed
each
no
longer
or
thicker
than
a
needle
i
ll
never
get
through
he
thought
not
ever
and
then
like
something
in
a
dream
he
heard
voices
overhead
muffled
and
indistinct
then
he
heard
a
louder
sound
the
crash
of
an
ax
breaking
through
one
of
the
walls
a
section
of
the
siding
gave
way
and
crashed
to
the
floor
the
voices
were
louder
now
and
ronnie
heard
footsteps
too
crossing
the
room
that
was
a
smoke
signal
we
saw
from
the
chimney
it
was
his
father
s
voice
speaking
as
sure
as
i
m
standing
here
it
was
a
signal
a
wide
grin
broadened
ronnie
s
face
and
lit
up
his
eyes
the
sound
of
his
father
s
voice
was
the
most
wonderful
thing
he
d
ever
heard
in
his
life
dad
dad
he
called
we
re
down
here
then
ronnie
turned
and
gently
shook
his
brother
you
can
wake
up
now
phil
dad
s
here
he
said
chapter
a
burning
august
sun
scorched
the
long
stretches
of
the
st
lawrence
river
valley
for
two
weeks
it
had
blazed
down
from
a
cloudless
sky
evaporating
the
last
remaining
moisture
from
the
soil
ronnie
came
out
of
the
house
and
crossed
the
barnyard
his
bare
feet
stirring
dust
clouds
that
hung
behind
him
and
marked
his
path
the
powder
dry
dust
felt
as
soft
as
talcum
against
the
soles
of
his
feet
ronnie
made
his
way
toward
the
orchard
here
it
was
cooler
for
the
earth
was
wet
from
days
of
irrigation
ronnie
spied
his
father
s
blue
overalls
and
white
t
shirt
among
the
peach
trees
to
the
right
pa
he
called
yes
ronnie
mr
rorth
was
reeling
out
a
section
of
rubber
hose
a
feeder
line
to
connect
to
the
main
metal
pipe
that
ran
to
the
brook
i
got
a
call
from
mr
mercer
just
a
while
ago
you
know
him
he
s
the
president
of
the
historical
society
in
town
he
wants
bill
and
me
to
come
to
a
meeting
tonight
he
says
the
seaway
people
will
have
a
big
official
there
to
discuss
the
village
that
s
wonderful
dad
will
you
drive
us
in
ronnie
asked
tonight
mr
rorth
thought
it
over
i
think
so
in
fact
i
d
kind
of
like
to
sit
in
on
that
meeting
myself
maybe
gramps
would
like
to
go
too
the
heat
s
got
him
bad
ronnie
reminded
his
father
yes
i
know
but
when
it
comes
to
the
village
gramps
would
go
from
here
to
timbuktu
in
the
hottest
weather
ronnie
grinned
yes
i
know
he
left
his
father
then
and
swung
off
toward
the
village
he
d
been
there
only
a
few
minutes
when
he
saw
two
men
approaching
one
of
them
was
carrying
a
transit
they
set
up
the
transit
on
a
level
spot
at
the
top
of
the
east
side
of
the
gap
one
man
stayed
with
the
instrument
while
the
other
climbed
to
the
other
side
of
the
stream
and
held
up
a
long
measured
stick
ronnie
went
over
to
him
what
re
you
doing
mister
surveying
i
mean
how
come
you
re
surveying
because
the
boss
sent
me
here
that
s
why
he
looked
over
at
the
boy
and
saw
that
ronnie
was
more
than
just
idly
curious
well
it
seems
there
s
going
to
be
a
meeting
tonight
and
the
boss
wants
some
figures
about
whether
it
s
possible
to
build
a
cofferdam
across
this
gap
he
added
do
you
think
it
can
be
built
ronnie
asked
and
held
his
breath
while
he
waited
for
the
answer
the
man
looked
about
him
examining
the
narrow
valley
with
its
steep
tree
filled
slopes
sure
he
answered
of
course
that
s
only
my
opinion
now
beat
it
kid
you
re
taking
my
mind
off
the
job
despite
the
heat
ronnie
began
to
run
he
felt
light
all
over
his
feet
hardly
seemed
to
touch
the
ground
the
dam
could
be
built
now
if
only
the
seaway
would
agree
to
have
it
done
if
the
meeting
tonight
was
a
success
he
vowed
then
there
would
be
nothing
more
he
could
ask
for
he
broke
out
of
a
thick
clump
of
hemlock
saplings
and
came
out
on
the
riverbank
just
as
his
brother
swung
himself
off
the
fallen
tree
trunk
on
the
end
of
their
ducking
rope
phil
arched
out
over
the
water
with
his
legs
curled
up
against
his
body
and
then
letting
go
dropped
like
a
bullet
he
came
up
sputtering
and
spitting
water
and
brushing
his
hair
from
his
eyes
come
on
in
ron
he
yelled
ronnie
undressed
quickly
and
soon
he
was
in
the
water
beside
his
brother
bill
appeared
minutes
later
his
leg
was
still
in
a
cast
darn
old
doctor
he
grumbled
good
naturedly
i
sure
wish
he
d
let
me
go
in
however
ronnie
had
devised
a
way
by
which
bill
could
at
least
get
cooled
off
after
bill
had
undressed
ronnie
and
phil
bound
his
cast
with
a
strip
of
canvas
they
had
on
hand
for
this
purpose
then
the
two
bombarded
bill
with
bucketful
after
bucketful
of
water
o
k
o
k
bill
called
for
mercy
enough
the
three
lay
down
on
a
moss
bank
to
dry
while
ronnie
described
his
meeting
with
the
surveyors
and
bill
he
went
on
we
ve
been
asked
to
a
meeting
tonight
with
the
historical
society
and
dad
says
he
ll
drive
us
into
town
bill
grinned
it
s
really
beginning
to
look
as
though
we
might
save
the
village
after
all
he
exclaimed
we
made
over
a
hundred
dollars
exhibiting
the
glassware
altogether
counting
the
money
we
found
down
in
the
culvert
and
what
we
earned
during
the
past
two
months
taking
tourists
around
the
village
and
what
we
got
from
selling
the
gold
and
silver
coins
to
a
collector
plus
the
exhibition
money
why
we
ve
got
over
three
thousand
dollars
exhibiting
the
glassware
had
been
ronnie
s
idea
but
it
was
mr
caldwell
who
had
done
a
great
deal
to
make
it
a
success
he
had
sent
announcements
to
antique
dealers
throughout
the
vicinity
and
many
of
them
had
come
curious
townspeople
had
come
too
and
each
visitor
had
been
charged
an
admission
fee
of
fifty
cents
i
wonder
when
mr
caldwell
will
be
back
bill
said
as
he
struggled
to
get
his
pants
over
the
cast
and
metal
support
he
s
been
gone
almost
two
weeks
now
i
guess
it
takes
time
to
work
out
all
those
legal
matters
ronnie
answered
ronnie
thought
about
mr
caldwell
as
he
and
phil
started
for
home
the
day
after
mr
caldwell
and
the
boys
had
been
rescued
from
the
culvert
caldwell
had
paid
a
call
on
grandfather
i
want
to
get
a
lawyer
to
make
out
papers
that
will
relinquish
all
jacob
williams
claims
to
the
deserted
village
he
had
announced
then
i
ll
go
up
to
the
penitentiary
and
have
my
brother
sign
them
too
supposing
he
refuses
grandfather
had
asked
caldwell
had
smiled
i
don
t
think
he
will
he
s
got
ten
years
of
his
old
sentence
to
finish
plus
whatever
he
gets
for
escaping
i
think
if
i
offer
him
a
small
amount
of
money
he
ll
see
my
way
well
now
grandfather
had
said
that
s
very
decent
of
you
mr
caldwell
but
why
should
you
go
to
all
this
trouble
and
expense
i
was
hoping
sir
caldwell
had
answered
that
you
and
ronnie
might
consider
letting
me
select
a
few
pieces
of
the
rorth
glassware
that
would
more
than
repay
me
caldwell
left
a
week
later
with
the
papers
the
lawyer
had
drawn
up
he
promised
to
return
as
soon
as
he
d
visited
his
brother
i
ve
got
plenty
of
work
left
on
my
book
he
had
told
ronnie
so
keep
my
place
cleaned
and
ready
for
me
when
ronnie
and
phil
reached
the
house
supper
was
already
on
the
table
grandfather
was
dressed
in
his
best
summer
suit
with
a
white
shirt
and
necktie
how
come
grandpa
phil
asked
how
come
why
you
don
t
think
for
one
minute
i
m
going
to
miss
that
meeting
tonight
thunderation
they
won
t
get
anywhere
unless
i
m
there
to
lend
a
hand
grandfather
did
lend
his
hand
that
night
and
his
voice
too
but
it
was
ronnie
s
plea
perhaps
which
did
the
most
toward
convincing
the
seaway
official
that
the
village
had
to
be
saved
mister
ronnie
told
him
sitting
on
one
side
of
the
long
conference
table
every
building
down
in
the
village
has
got
a
story
to
tell
about
its
past
gramps
told
me
all
of
them
when
i
was
a
boy
and
i
ve
never
forgotten
a
one
lots
of
these
stories
i
ve
told
to
the
tourists
who
have
come
to
see
the
village
and
do
you
know
what
so
many
of
them
have
said
to
me
when
they
left
they
said
they
d
never
been
anywhere
that
helped
them
so
much
to
understand
how
people
lived
and
worked
back
in
the
last
century
and
if
the
village
can
be
saved
you
know
what
we
can
do
well
we
ve
got
enough
of
the
old
furnishings
left
from
the
general
store
for
instance
to
fit
it
out
just
like
it
was
a
hundred
years
ago
and
gramps
says
that
with
some
fixing
up
we
can
do
the
same
thing
for
the
gristmill
the
smith
shop
and
even
the
main
glassworks
can
t
we
gramps
ronnie
asked
smiling
across
at
his
grandfather
why
you
bet
we
can
boy
that
village
is
just
chuck
full
of
history
after
the
meeting
mr
mercer
ronnie
s
grandfather
and
father
a
lawyer
whom
the
historical
society
had
hired
and
the
official
from
the
seaway
went
into
a
smaller
room
in
the
back
of
the
building
and
closed
the
door
ronnie
phil
and
bill
waited
in
the
car
it
was
almost
an
hour
later
before
gramps
and
dad
joined
them
grandfather
was
smiling
well
we
did
it
lad
he
said
to
ronnie
and
the
others
we
ve
got
ourselves
a
proposition
that
ll
save
the
village
during
the
ride
home
gramps
did
most
of
the
talking
you
ve
got
to
put
in
the
money
you
boys
have
earned
and
the
money
you
found
he
explained
the
terms
of
the
agreement
the
historical
society
will
lend
another
three
thousand
you
ve
got
to
pay
that
back
ronnie
from
money

get
showing
people
around
the
village

seaway

rest
of
the
bill

the
dam
and
maintain
it
yipee
ronnie
exclaimed
i
m
right
proud
of
you
ronnie
proud
of
all
you
boys
grandfather
added
that
seaway
fellow
told
me
that
it
was
what
you
boys
have
done
this
summer
that
convinced
him
he
said
any
youngsters
who
would
put
their
hearts
and
souls
and
time
into
something
worthwhile
like
this
why
they
deserved
to
get
what
they
were
working
for
late
that
night
a
thunderstorm
broke
thunder
boomed
incessantly
and
the
lightning
was
so
vivid
that
ronnie
s
room
was
as
bright
as
noonday
but
twenty
minutes
later
the
storm
had
stopped
and
when
ronnie
opened
his
window
again
a
cool
breeze
blew
through
when
grandfather
came
into
the
kitchen
for
breakfast
the
next
morning
he
was
as
full
of
life
and
pep
as
a
puppy
prayed
for
this
cool
weather
i
did
he
exclaimed
prayed
for
cool
weather
and
i
prayed
for
the
village
too
seems
like
i
got
both
my
wishes
after
breakfast
ronnie
and
grandfather
took
a
walk
i
want
to
see
the
village
again
grandfather
said
i
want
to
see
it
again
knowing
that
it
ll
be
here
after
i
m
gone
and
even
after
you
re
gone
ronnie
he
stepped
along
briskly
as
if
suddenly
he
d
found
a
new
pair
of
legs
they
stood
at
the
top
of
the
bluff
near
a
large
bull
hickory
tree
below
the
village
lay
peaceful
and
quiet
in
the
early
morning
light
the
red
brick
of
the
glassworks
caught
the
sunlight
and
reflected
it
glowing
like
molten
lava
i
m
proud
of
you
lad
grandfather
was
talking
again
i
m
proud
of
you
for
helping
to
save
the
village
and
bringing
back
honor
and
respect
to
the
rorth
name
and
you

to
yourself
a
little
bit
of

for

from
the
working
and
