// A README text file that explains what the project is and how to use its controls

This project is a game based off of the original Japanese game Space Invaders, a game released in 1978 by Taito which is a fixed shooter in which the player moves a laser cannon horizontally across the bottom of the screen and fires at aliens overhead as they move downward.

Open the Final_Project.pde file and click 'Run' to to run our game. In the pop-up screen, you can read the game controls and rules.

The controls consist of moving left and right via the left and right arrow keys, and using the spacebar to shoot bullets from the ship. Press the "b" button to change the color of the bullets from white to red. Press "s" to change the color of the background sky from black to dark blue. Press the "x" button to restart the game. A mute switch in the top right corner of the game screen can be clicked to mute the background music and clicked again to re-enable the music.
